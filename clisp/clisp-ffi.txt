A foreign function description is written as a Lisp file, and when
compiled it produces a #P".c" file which is then compiled by the C
compiler and may be linked together with lisp.a.

All symbols relating to the foreign function interface are exported
from the package "FFI".. To use them, (USE-PACKAGE "FFI").

Special "FFI". forms may appear anywhere in the Lisp file.


30.3.1.  Overview

These are the special "FFI". forms. We have taken a pragmatic
approach: the only foreign languages we support for now are C and ANSI
C.  special "FFI". forms; name is any Lisp SYMBOL; c-name is a STRING.


(FFI:DEF-C-TYPE name c-type)

    This form makes name a shortcut for c-type. Note that c-type may
    already refer to name. Forward declarations of types are not
    possible, however.


(FFI:DEF-C-VAR name {option}*)

    This form defines a FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE. name is the Lisp name,
    a regular Lisp SYMBOL.


    Options for FFI:DEF-C-VAR


    (:NAME c-name)

        specifies the name as seen from C, as a string. If not
        specified, it is derived from the print name of the Lisp
        name.


    (:TYPE c-type)

        specifies the variable's foreign type.


    (:READ-ONLY BOOLEAN)

        If this option is specified and non-NIL, it will be
        impossible to change the variable's value from within Lisp
        (using SETQ or similar).


    (:ALLOC ALLOCATION)

        This option can be either :NONE or :MALLOC-FREE and defaults
        to :NONE. If it is :MALLOC-FREE, any values of type
        FFI:C-STRING, FFI:C-PTR, FFI:C-PTR-NULL, FFI:C-ARRAY-PTR
        within the foreign value are assumed to be pointers to
        malloc-allocated storage, and when SETQ replaces an old
        value by a new one, the old storage is freed using free and
        the new storage allocated using malloc. If it is :NONE, SETQ
        assumes that the pointers point to good storage (not NULL!)
        and overwrites the old values by the new ones. This is
        dangerous (just think of overwriting a string with a longer
        one or storing some data in a NULL pointer...) and
        deprecated.


    (:LIBRARY STRING)

        Specifies the (optional) dynamic library which contains the
        variable.


(FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT name {option}*)

    This form defines a named call-out function (a foreign function
    called from Lisp: control flow temporarily leaves Lisp).

    Options for FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT

    (:NAME c-name)

        Any Lisp function call to #'name is redirected to call the C
        function c-name.


    (:ARGUMENTS {(argument c-type [PARAM-MODE [ALLOCATION]])}*)
    (:RETURN-TYPE c-type [ALLOCATION])

        Argument list and return value, see Section  30.3.7,
        "Argument and result passing conventions". and Section
         30.3.8, "Parameter Mode"..


    (:LANGUAGE language)

        See Section  30.3.3, "The choice of the C flavor."..


    (:BUILT-IN BOOLEAN)

        When the function is a C built-in, the full prototype will
        be output (unless suppressed by FFI:*OUTPUT-C-FUNCTIONS*).


    (:LIBRARY STRING)

        Specifies the (optional) dynamic library which contains the
        variable.



(FFI:DEF-CALL-IN name {option}*)

    This form defines a named call-in function (i.e., a Lisp function
    called from the foreign language: control flow temporary enters
    Lisp)

    Options for FFI:DEF-CALL-IN


    (:NAME c-name)

        Any C function call to the C function c-name is redirected
        to call the Common Lisp function #'name.


    (:ARGUMENTS {(argument c-type [PARAM-MODE [ALLOCATION]])}*)
    (:RETURN-TYPE c-type [ALLOCATION])

        Argument list and return value, see Section  30.3.7,
        "Argument and result passing conventions". and Section
         30.3.8, "Parameter Mode"..


    (:LANGUAGE language)

        See Section  30.3.3, "The choice of the C flavor."..



(FFI:DEF-C-CALL-OUT name {option}*)

    This is equivalent to FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT with :LANGUAGE :STDC. deprecated.



(FFI:DEF-C-CALL-IN name {option}*)

    This is equivalent to FFI:DEF-CALL-IN with :LANGUAGE
    :STDC. deprecated.



(FFI:DEF-C-STRUCT name (symbol c-type)*)

    This form defines name to be both a STRUCTURE-CLASS and a foreign
    C type with the given slots. name is a SYMBOL (structure name) or
    a LIST whose FIRST element is the structure name and the REST is
    options. Two options are supported at this time:

    Options for FFI:DEF-C-STRUCT

    :TYPEDEF

        means that the name of this structure is a C type defined
        with typedef elsewhere.

    :EXTERNAL

        means that this structure is defined in a #P".c" file that
        you include with, e.g., (FFI:C-LINES "#include
        <filename.h>").

    These options determine how the struct is written to the #P".c".



(FFI:DEF-C-ENUM name {symbol | (symbol [value])}*)

    This form defines symbols as constants, similarly to the C
    declaration enum { symbol [= value], ... };

    You can use (FFI:ENUM-FROM-VALUE name value) and
    (FFI:ENUM-TO-VALUE name symbol) to convert between the numeric
    and symbolic representations (of course, the latter function
    boils down to SYMBOL-VALUE plus a check that the symbol is indeed
    a constant defined in the FFI:DEF-C-ENUM name).



(FFI:C-LINES format-string {argument}*)

    This form outputs the string (FORMAT NIL format-string
    {argument}*) to the C output file. This is a rarely needed
    low-level facility.



(FFI:ELEMENT c-place index1 ... indexn)

    Array element: If c-place is of foreign type (FFI:C-ARRAY c-type
    (dim1 ... dimn)) and 0 â%ooeôôÌ index1 < dim1, ..., 0 â%ooeôôÌ
    indexn < dimn, this will be the place corresponding to (AREF
    c-place index1 ... indexn) or c-place[index1]...[indexn]. It is a
    place of type c-type. If c-place is of foreign type
    (FFI:C-ARRAY-MAX c-type dim) and 0 â%ooeôôÌ index < dim, this will
    be the place corresponding to (AREF c-place index) or
    c-place[index]. It is a place of type c-type.



(FFI:DEREF c-place)

    Dereference pointer: If c-place is of foreign type (FFI:C-PTR
    c-type) or (FFI:C-PTR-NULL c-type), this will be the place the
    pointer points to. It is a place of type c-type. For
    (FFI:C-PTR-NULL c-type), the c-place may not be NULL.



(FFI:SLOT c-place slot-name)

    Struct or union component: If c-place is of foreign type
    (FFI:C-STRUCT class ... (slot-name c-type) ...) or of type
    (FFI:C-UNION ... (slot-name c-type) ...), this will be of type
    c-type.



(FFI:CAST c-place c-type)

    Type change: A place denoting the same memory locations as the
    original c-place, but of type c-type.



(FFI:OFFSET c-place offset c-type)

    Type change and displacement: return a place denoting a memory
    locations displaced from the original c-place by an offset
    counted in bytes, with type c-type. This can be used to resize an
    array, e.g. of c-type (FFI:C-ARRAY uint16 n) via (FFI:OFFSET
    c-place 0 '(FFI:C-ARRAY uint16 k)).



(FFI:C-VAR-ADDRESS c-place)

    Return the address of c-place as a Lisp object of type
    FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS. This is useful as an argument to foreign functions
    expecting a parameter of C type FFI:C-POINTER.



(FFI:C-VAR-OBJECT c-place)

    Return the FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE object underlying the
    c-place. This is also an acceptable argument type to a
    FFI:C-POINTER declaration.



(FFI:TYPEOF c-place)

    returns the c-type corresponding to the c-place.



(FFI:SIZEOF c-type)
(FFI:SIZEOF c-place)

    The first form returns the size and alignment of the C type
    c-type, measured in bytes.

    The second form returns the size and alignment of the C type of
    c-place, measured in bytes.



(FFI:BITSIZEOF c-type)
(FFI:BITSIZEOF c-place)

    The first form returns the size and alignment of the C type
    c-type, measured in bits.

    The second form returns the size and alignment of the C type of
    c-place, measured in bits.



(FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS-NULL foreign-entity)

    This predicate returns T if the foreign-entity refers to the NULL
    address (and thus foreign-entity should probably not be passed to
    most foreign functions).



(FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS-UNSIGNED foreign-entity)
(FFI:UNSIGNED-FOREIGN-ADDRESS number)

    FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS-UNSIGNED returns the INTEGER address embodied
    in the Lisp object of type FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS,
    FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER, FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE or FFI:FOREIGN-FUNCTION.

    FFI:UNSIGNED-FOREIGN-ADDRESS returns a FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS object
    pointing to the given INTEGER address.



(FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS foreign-entity)

    FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS is both a type name and a
    selector/constructor function. It is the Lisp object type
    corresponding to a FFI:C-POINTER external type declaration,
    e.g. a call-out function with (:RETURN-TYPE FFI:C-POINTER) yields
    a Lisp object of type FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS.

    The function extracts the object of type FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS
    living within any FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE or FFI:FOREIGN-FUNCTION
    object. If the foreign-entity already is a FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS,
    it returns it. If it is a FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER (e.g. a base
    foreign library address), it encapsulates it into a
    FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS object, as suitable for use with a
    FFI:C-POINTER external type declaration. It does not construct
    addresses out of NUMBERs, FFI:UNSIGNED-FOREIGN-ADDRESS must be
    used for that purpose.



(FFI:VALIDP foreign-entity)
(SETF (FFI:VALIDP foreign-entity) value)

    This predicate returns NIL if the foreign-entity (e.g. the Lisp
    equivalent of a FFI:C-POINTER) refers to a pointer which is
    invalid because it comes from a previous Lisp session. It returns
    T if foreign-entity can be used within the current Lisp process
    (thus it returns T for all non-foreign arguments).

    You can invalidate a foreign object using (SETF FFI:VALIDP). You
    cannot resurrect a zombie, nor can you kill a non-foreign object.



(FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER foreign-entity)
(SETF (FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER foreign-entity) foreign-pointer)

    FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER returns the FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER associated
    with the Lisp object of type FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS,
    FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER, FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE or
    FFI:FOREIGN-FUNCTION. (SETF FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER) changes the
    FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER associated with the Lisp object of type
    FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS, FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE or FFI:FOREIGN-FUNCTION
    to that of the other entity. When foreign-pointer is :COPY, a
    fresh FFI:FOREIGN-POINTER is allocated. foreign-entity still
    points to the same object. This is particularly useful with (SETF
    FFI:VALIDP).



(FFI:WITH-FOREIGN-OBJECT (variable c-type [initarg]) body)
(FFI:WITH-C-VAR (variable c-type [initarg]) body)

    These forms allocate space on the C execution stack, bind
    respectively a FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE object or a local SYMBOL-MACRO
    to variable and execute body.

    When initarg is not supplied, they allocate space only for
    (FFI:SIZEOF c-type) bytes. This space is filled with zeroes. E.g.,
    using a c-type of FFI:C-STRING or even (FFI:C-PTR (FFI:C-ARRAY
    uint8 32)) (!) both allocate place for a single pointer,
    initialized to NULL.

    When initarg is supplied, they allocate space for an arbitrarily
    complex set of structures rooted in c-type. Therefore,
    FFI:C-ARRAY-MAX, #() and "" are your friends for creating a
    pointer to the empty arrays:

     (with-c-var (v '(c-ptr (c-array-max uint8 32)) #())
        (setf  (element (deref v) 0) 127) v)

    c-type is evaluated, making creation of variable sized buffers
    easy:

     (with-c-var (fv `(c-array uint8 ,(length my-vector)) my-vector)
       (print fv))




(FFI:WITH-FOREIGN-STRING (foreign-address char-count byte-count string
                          &KEY encoding null-terminated-p start end) &BODY body)

    This forms converts a Lisp string according to the encoding,
    allocating space on the C execution stack. encoding can be any
    EXT:ENCODING, e.g. CHARSET:UTF-16 or CHARSET:UTF-8, circumventing
    the usual 1:1 limit imposed on CUSTOM:*FOREIGN-ENCODING*.

    body is then executed with the three variables foreign-address,
    char-count and byte-count respectively bound to an untyped
    FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS (as known from the FFI:C-POINTER foreign type
    specification) pointing to the stack location, the number of
    CHARACTERs of the Lisp string that were considered and the number
    of (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) bytes that were allocated for it on the C
    stack.

    When null-terminated-p is true, which is the default, a variable
    number of zero bytes is appended, depending on the encoding,
    e.g. 2 for CHARSET:UTF-8, and accounted for in byte-count, and
    char-count is incremented by one.

    The FFI:FOREIGN-ADDRESS object bound to foreign-address is
    invalidated upon the exit from the form.

    A stupid example (a quite costly interface to mblen):

     (with-foreign-string (fv elems bytes string

                      :encoding charset:jis... :null-terminated-p nil

                      :end 5)
      (declare (ignore fv elems))
      (format t "This string would take ~D bytes." bytes))



(FFI:PARSE-C-TYPE c-type)
(FFI:DEPARSE-C-TYPE c-type-internal)

    Convert between the external (LIST) and internal (VECTOR) C type
    representations (used by DESCRIBE).



(FFI:ALLOCATE-SHALLOW c-type &KEY :COUNT :READ-ONLY)
(FFI:ALLOCATE-DEEP c-type contents &KEY :COUNT :READ-ONLY)
(FFI:FOREIGN-FREE foreign-entity &KEY :FULL)
(FFI:FOREIGN-ALLOCATE c-type-internal &KEY :INITIAL-CONTENTS :COUNT :READ-ONLY)

    Macro FFI:ALLOCATE-SHALLOW allocates (FFI:SIZEOF c-type) bytes on
    the C heap and zeroes them out (like calloc). When :COUNT is
    supplied, c-type is substituted with (FFI:C-ARRAY c-type count),
    except when c-type is CHARACTER, in which case (FFI:C-ARRAY-MAX
    CHARACTER count) is used instead. When :READ-ONLY is supplied, the
    Lisp side is prevented from modifying the memory contents. This
    can be used as an indication that some foreign side is going to
    fill this memory (e.g. via read).

    Returns a FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE object of the actual c-type, whose
    address part points to the newly allocated memory.

    FFI:ALLOCATE-DEEP will call C malloc as many times as necessary to
    build a structure on the C heap of the given c-type, initialized
    from the given contents.

    E.g., (FFI:ALLOCATE-DEEP 'FFI:C-STRING "ABCDE") performs 2
    allocations: one for a C pointer to a string, another for the
    contents of that string. This would be useful in conjunction with
    a char** C type declaration. (FFI:ALLOCATE-SHALLOW 'FFI:C-STRING)
    allocates room for a single pointer (probably 4 bytes).

    (FFI:ALLOCATE-DEEP 'CHARACTER "ABCDEF" :count 10) allocates and
    initializes room for the type (FFI:C-ARRAY-MAX CHARACTER 10),
    corresponding to char* or, more specifically, char[10] in C.

    Function FFI:FOREIGN-FREE deallocates memory at the address held
    by the given foreign-entity. If :FULL is supplied and the argument
    is of type FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE, recursively frees the whole
    complex stucture pointed to by this variable.

    If given a FFI:FOREIGN-FUNCTION object that corresponds to a CLISP
    callback, deallocates it. Callbacks are automatically created each
    time you pass a Lisp function via the "FFI"..

    Use (SETF FFI:VALIDP) to disable further references to this
    address from Lisp. This is currently not done automatically. If
    the given pointer is already invalid, FFI:FOREIGN-FREE (currently)
    signals an ERROR. This may change to make it easier to integrate
    with EXT:FINALIZE.

    Function FFI:FOREIGN-ALLOCATE is a lower-level interface as it
    requires an internal C type descriptor as returned by
    FFI:PARSE-C-TYPE.



(FFI:WITH-C-PLACE (variable foreign-entity) body)

    Create a place out of the given FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE object so
    operations on places (e.g. FFI:CAST, FFI:DEREF, FFI:SLOT etc.) can
    be used within body. FFI:WITH-C-VAR appears as a composition of
    FFI:WITH-FOREIGN-OBJECT and FFI:WITH-C-PLACE.

    Such a place can be used to access memory referenced by a
    foreign-entity object:

     (setq foo (allocate-deep '(c-array uint8 3) rgb))
     (with-c-place (place foo) (element place 0))




FFI:*OUTPUT-C-FUNCTIONS*
FFI:*OUTPUT-C-VARIABLES*

    CLISP will write the extern declarations for foreign functions
    (defined with FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT) and foreign variables (defined
    with FFI:DEF-C-VAR) into the output #P".c" (when the Lisp file is
    compiled with COMPILE-FILE) unless these variables are NIL. They
    are NIL by default, so the extern declarations are not written;
    you are encouraged to use FFI:C-LINES to include the appropriate C
    headers. Set these variables to non-NIL if the headers are not
    available or not usable.




30.3.2.  (Foreign) C types

Foreign C types are used in the "FFI".. They are not regular Common
Lisp types or CLOS classes.

A c-type is either a predefined C type or the name of a type defined
by FFI:DEF-C-TYPE.

FFI:C-POINTER

    This type corresponds to what C calls void*, an opaque
    pointer. When used as an argument, NIL is accepted as a
    FFI:C-POINTER and treated as NULL; when a function wants to return
    a NULL FFI:C-POINTER, it actually returns NIL.


FFI:C-STRING

    This type corresponds to what C calls char*, a zero-terminated
    string. Its Lisp equivalent is a string, without the trailing zero
    character.


(FFI:C-STRUCT class (ident1 c-type1) ... (identn c-typen))

    This type is equivalent to what C calls struct { c-type1 ident1;
    ...; c-typen identn; }. Its Lisp equivalent is: if class is
    VECTOR, a SIMPLE-VECTOR; if class is LIST, a proper list; if class
    is a symbol naming a structure or CLOS class, an instance of this
    class, with slots of names ident1, ..., identn.
    class may also be a CONS of a SYMBOL (as above) and a LIST of
    FFI:DEF-C-STRUCT options.


(FFI:C-UNION (ident1 c-type1) ... (identn c-typen))

    This type is equivalent to what C calls union { c-type1 ident1;
    ...; c-typen identn; }. Conversion to and from Lisp assumes that a
    value is to be viewed as being of c-type1.


(FFI:C-ARRAY c-type dim1)
(FFI:C-ARRAY c-type (dim1 ... dimn))

    This type is equivalent to what C calls c-type [dim1]
    ... [dimn]. Note that when an array is passed as an argument to a
    function in C, it is actually passed as a pointer; you therefore
    have to write (FFI:C-PTR (FFI:C-ARRAY ...))  for this argument's
    type.


(FFI:C-ARRAY-MAX c-type maxdimension)

    This type is equivalent to what C calls c-type [maxdimension], an
    array containing up to maxdimension elements. The array is
    zero-terminated if it contains less than maxdimension
    elements. Conversion from Lisp of an array with more than
    maxdimension elements silently ignores the superfluous elements.


(FFI:C-FUNCTION (:ARGUMENTS {(argument a-c-type [PARAM-MODE [ALLOCATION]])}*)
                (:RETURN-TYPE r-c-type [ALLOCATION]) (:LANGUAGE language))

    This type designates a C function that can be called according to
    the given prototype (r-c-type (*) (a-c-type1, ...)). Conversion
    between C functions and Lisp functions is transparent, and
    NULL/NIL is recognized and accepted.


(FFI:C-PTR c-type)

    This type is equivalent to what C calls c-type *: a pointer to a
    single item of the given c-type.


(FFI:C-PTR-NULL c-type)

    This type is also equivalent to what C calls c-type *: a pointer
    to a single item of the given c-type, with the exception that C
    NULL corresponds to Lisp NIL.



(FFI:C-ARRAY-PTR c-type)

    This type is equivalent to what C calls c-type (*)[]: a pointer to
    a zero-terminated array of items of the given c-type.
    CUSTOM:*FOREIGN-ENCODING* governs conversion for any c-type
    involving FFI:C-STRING or CHARACTER (but not char).



30.3.3.  The choice of the C flavor.

FFI:C-FUNCTION, FFI:DEF-CALL-IN, FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT take :LANGUAGE
argument. The language is either :C (denotes K&R C) or :STDC (denotes
ANSI C) or :STDC-STDCALL (denotes ANSI C with the stdcall calling
convention). It specifies whether the C function (caller or callee)
has been compiled by a K&R C compiler or by an ANSI C compiler, and
possibly the calling convention.

The default language is set using the macro
FFI:DEFAULT-FOREIGN-LANGUAGE. If this macro has not been called in the
current compilation unit (usually a file), a warning is issued and
:STDC is used for the rest of the unit.



30.3.4.  Foreign variables

Foreign variables are variables whose storage is allocated in the
foreign language module. They can nevertheless be evaluated and
modified through SETQ, just as normal variables can, except that the
range of allowed values is limited according to the variable's foreign
type. Note that for a foreign variable x the form (EQL x x) is not
necessarily true, since every time x is evaluated its foreign value is
converted to a fresh Lisp value. Foreign variables are defined using
FFI:DEF-C-VAR.



30.3.5.  Operations on foreign places

A FFI:FOREIGN-VARIABLE name defined by FFI:DEF-C-VAR, FFI:WITH-C-VAR
or FFI:WITH-C-PLACE defines a place, i.e., a form which can also be
used as argument to SETF. (An "lvalue" in C terminology.) The
following operations are available on foreign places: FFI:ELEMENT,
FFI:DEREF, FFI:SLOT, FFI:CAST, FFI:OFFSET, FFI:C-VAR-ADDRESS,
FFI:C-VAR-OBJECT, FFI:TYPEOF, FFI:SIZEOF, FFI:BITSIZEOF.



30.3.6.  Foreign functions

Foreign functions are functions which are defined in the foreign
language. There are named foreign functions (imported via FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT or
created via FFI:DEF-CALL-IN) and anonymous foreign functions; they arise
through conversion of function pointers.

A "call-out" function is a foreign function called from Lisp: control flow
temporarily leaves Lisp. A "call-in" function is a Lisp function called from
the foreign language: control flow temporary enters Lisp.

The following forms define foreign functions: FFI:DEF-CALL-IN,
FFI:DEF-CALL-OUT, FFI:DEF-C-CALL-IN, FFI:DEF-C-CALL-OUT.



30.3.7.  Argument and result passing conventions

When passed to and from functions, allocation of arguments and results is
handled as follows:

Values of SIMPLE-C-TYPE, FFI:C-POINTER are passed on the stack, with dynamic
extent. The ALLOCATION is effectively ignored.

Values of type FFI:C-STRING, FFI:C-PTR, FFI:C-PTR-NULL, FFI:C-ARRAY-PTR need
storage. The ALLOCATION specifies the allocation policy:

:NONE         no storage is allocated.
:ALLOCA       allocation of storage on the stack, which has dynamic extent.
:MALLOC-FREE  storage will be allocated via malloc and freed via free.

If no ALLOCATION is specified, the default ALLOCATION is :NONE for most types,
but :ALLOCA for FFI:C-STRING and FFI:C-PTR and FFI:C-PTR-NULL and
FFI:C-ARRAY-PTR and for :OUT arguments. [Subject to change!] The :MALLOC-FREE
policy provides the ability to pass arbitrarily nested structs containing
pointers pointing to structs ... within a single conversion.


For call-out functions:

    For arguments passed from Lisp to C:

        If ALLOCATION is :MALLOC-FREE:

             Lisp allocates the storage using malloc and never
             deallocates it. The C function is supposed to call free
             when done with it.


        If ALLOCATION is :ALLOCA:

             Lisp allocates the storage on the stack, with dynamic
             extent. It is freed when the C function returns.


        If ALLOCATION is :NONE:

             Lisp assumes that the pointer already points to a valid
             area of the proper size and puts the result value
             there. This is dangerous! and deprecated.

    For results passed from C to Lisp:

        If ALLOCATION is :MALLOC-FREE:

             Lisp calls free on it when done.


        If ALLOCATION is :NONE:

             Lisp does nothing.


For call-in functions:

    For arguments passed from C to Lisp:

        If ALLOCATION is :MALLOC-FREE:

             Lisp calls free on it when done.


        If ALLOCATION is :ALLOCA or :NONE:

             Lisp does nothing.

    For results passed from Lisp to C:

        If ALLOCATION is :MALLOC-FREE:

             Lisp allocates the storage using malloc and never
             deallocates it. The C function is supposed to call free
             when done with it.


        If ALLOCATION is :NONE:

             Lisp assumes that the pointer already points to a valid
             area of the proper size and puts the result value
             there. This is dangerous! and deprecated.


    Warning: Passing FFI:C-STRUCT, FFI:C-UNION, FFI:C-ARRAY,
    FFI:C-ARRAY-MAX values as arguments (not via pointers) is only
    possible to the extent the C compiler supports it. Most C
    compilers do it right, but some C compilers (such as gcc on hppa
    and Win32) have problems with this. The recommended workaround is
    to pass pointers; this is fully supported. See also this
    <clisp-list@sf.net> message.




30.3.8.  Parameter Mode

A function parameter's PARAM-MODE may be

:IN (means: read-only):

     The caller passes information to the callee.

:OUT (means: write-only):

     The callee passes information back to the caller on return. When
     viewed as a Lisp function, there is no Lisp argument corresponding to
     this, instead it means an additional return value.

:IN-OUT (means: read-write):

     Information is passed from the caller to the callee and then back to
     the caller. When viewed as a Lisp function, the :OUT value is returned as
     an additional multiple value.

The default is :IN.

[Currently, only :IN is fully implemented. :OUT works only with ALLOCATION =
:ALLOCA.]
