<h1 align="center">Common-Lisp-Posix</h1>

<p>The Common-Lisp-Posix project has two purposes:

<ul>

<li>The main purpose is to define a Common-Lisp SUSv3/POSIX API.

<li>The secondary purpose is to write a couple of reference
implementations for <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">sbcl</a> 
and <a href="http://clisp.sourceforge.net/">clisp</a>.

</ul>


<p>The programming language will be Common-Lisp.
<p>The target OSes will be all SuSv3/POSIX compliant OSes.
<p>One reference implementation may use the UFFI package.

<a href="http://www.unix.org/version3/overview.html"> 
The Single UNIX Specification Version 3
</a>
consists of:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/index.html">
 The Open Group Base Specifications, Issue 6. 
 </a>, which contains the following Technical Standards:
<ul>
<li>Base Definitions, Issue 6 (XBD)
<li>Shell and Utilities, Issue 6 (XCU)
<li>System Interfaces, Issue 6 (XSH)
<li>Rationale (Informative)
</ul>

<li>and the X/Open Curses, Issue 4, Version 2 specification.
</ul>




<p>The  <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/frontmatter/preface.html"> Preface </a> of the The Open Group Base Specifications, Issue 6 lists the following principle that guided the development of that standard:

<ul>

<li><em>Application-Oriented</em>

     <blockquote> The basic goal was to promote portability of application
    programs across UNIX system environments by developing a clear,
    consistent, and unambiguous standard for the interface
    specification of a portable operating system based on the UNIX
    system documentation. This standard codifies the common, existing
    definition of the UNIX system. 
     </blockquote>
     
     <p>We keep this principle verbatim for this Common-Lisp API.

<li><em>Interface, Not Implementation</em>

     <blockquote> This standard defines an interface, not an
    implementation. No distinction is made between library functions
    and system calls; both are referred to as functions. No details of
    the implementation of any function are given (although historical
    practice is sometimes indicated in the RATIONALE
    section). Symbolic names are given for constants (such as signals
    and error numbers) rather than numbers. 
    </blockquote>

     <p>We keep this principle verbatim for this Common-Lisp API.

<li><em> Source, Not Object, Portability</em>

     <blockquote> This standard has been written so that a program written
    and translated for execution on one conforming implementation may
    also be translated for execution on another conforming
    implementation. This standard does not guarantee that executable
    (object or binary) code will execute under a different conforming
    implementation than that for which it was translated, even if the
    underlying hardware is identical. 
    </blockquote>

     <p>We keep this principle verbatim for this Common-Lisp API.


<li> The C Language

     <blockquote> The system interfaces and header definitions are written
    in terms of the standard C language as specified in the ISO C
    standard.
     </blockquote>

   <p> Of course, this principle is replaced by:

<li><em>The Common-Lisp Language</em>

     <p>The system interfaces and header definitions are written
    in terms of the standard Common-Lisp language as specified in the 
    <a href="http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/index.html">
    ANSI Common Lisp standard.</a>
     </blockquote>


<li><em> No Superuser, No System Administration</em>

      <blockquote>There was no intention to specify all aspects of an
    operating system. System administration facilities and functions
    are excluded from this standard, and functions usable only by the
    superuser have not been included. Still, an implementation of the
    standard interface may also implement features not in this
    standard. This standard is also not concerned with hardware
    constraints or system maintenance. 
     </blockquote>

     <p>We keep this principle verbatim for this Common-Lisp API.

<li><em> Minimal Interface, Minimally Defined</em>

      <blockquote>In keeping with the historical design principles of the
    UNIX system, the mandatory core facilities of this standard have
    been kept as minimal as possible. Additional capabilities have
    been added as optional extensions. 
    </blockquote>

     <p>We keep this principle verbatim for this Common-Lisp API.

<li><em> Broadly Implementable</em>

    <blockquote>  The developers of this standard endeavored to make all
         specified functions implementable across a wide range of
         existing and potential systems, including:

      <ol>

        <li> All of the current major systems that are ultimately
        derived from the original UNIX system code (Version 7 or later)

        <li> Compatible systems that are not derived from the original
        UNIX system code

         <li>Emulations hosted on entirely different operating systems

         <li> Networked systems

         <li>Distributed systems

          <li>Systems running on a broad range of hardware

       </ol>

      No direct references to this goal appear in this standard, but
    some results of it are mentioned in the Rationale (Informative)
    volume. 
       </blockquote>

     <p>We keep this principle verbatim for this Common-Lisp API.


<li> Minimal Changes to Historical Implementations

   <p>There is no known POSIX API for Common-Lisp, 
      no Historical Implementations.

   <p>However, beyond lispifying the C POSIX API, we endeavour to specify
     minimal change with respect to the C POSIX API: given some simple rules,
     a programmer knowing the C POSIX API should be able to program easily 
     with the Common-Lisp POSIX API.
    
<li>  Minimal Changes to Existing Application Code

   <p>There  is no known  Common-Lisp application  using a  POSIX API,
   safe perhaps  for a  few applications using  API such as  the LINUX
   package in CLISP or the UNIX package in SBCL...
