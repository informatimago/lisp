;;;;    a stream and a buffer in such a way that reading, peeking or
;;;;    unreading characters can be done in any number and in any order.
;;;;
;;;;    We don't use gray stream to keep it pure Common-Lisp.
;;;;    The I/O methods are GETCHAR, UNGETCHAR and NEXTCHAR to avoid
;;;;    name clashes with un-generic READ-CHAR, UNREAD-CHAR and PEEK-CHAR.
;;;;
;;;;AUTHORS
;;;;    <PJB> Pascal J. Bourguignon <pjb@informatimago.com>
;;;;MODIFICATIONS
;;;;    2012-07-15 <PJB> Re-implemented NEXTCHAR with same semantics as PEEKCHAR.
;;;;                     (The old NEXTCHAR behavior is available as GET-FUTURE-CHAR).
;;;;    2012-02-07 <PJB> Corrected mod-incf and mod-decf.
;;;;    2004-09-06 <PJB> Extracted from parse-html.
;;;;BUGS
;;;;    Does not implement other I/O than these three character input methods.

This package exports a class named PEEK-STREAM that encapsulates a
stream and a buffer in such a way that reading, peeking or unreading
characters can be done in any number and in any order.

We don't use gray stream to keep it pure Common-Lisp.  The I/O methods
are GETCHAR, UNGETCHAR and NEXTCHAR to avoid name clashes with
un-generic READ-CHAR, UNREAD-CHAR and PEEK-CHAR.

DO:             Just like CL:PEEK-CHAR.

                If peek-type is not supplied or NIL, peek-char returns
                the next character to be read from input-stream,
                without actually removing it from input-stream. The
                next time input is done from input-stream, the
                character will still be there.

                If  peek-type is T, then peek-char skips over
                whitespace[2] characters, but not comments, and then
                performs the peeking operation on the next
                character. The last character examined, the one that
                starts an object, is not removed from  input-stream.

                If peek-type is a CHARACTER, then peek-char skips over
                input characters until a character that is char= to
                that character is found; that character is left in
                input-stream.

RETURN:         The same character that will be returned by the next
                (getchar self).

NOTE:           There's no conforming way to determine whether a
                character has the whitespace[2] syntax in the current
                *readtable*.  Therefore we use instead the
                PEEK-STREAM-SPACES method to get the list of spaces.
