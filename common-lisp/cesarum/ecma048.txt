Brief History As part of the work on coded character set standards, TC1, the coding committee of ECMA, worked on the definition and the coding of control functions to be used with the various standards for coded graphic character sets produced by ECMA, viz. ECMA-6, ECMA-94, ECMA-113, ECMA-114, ECMA-118, ECMA-121, ECMA-128, and ECMA-144. The first edition of this Standard ECMA-48 was published in 1976. Further editions followed. The fourth edition, published in 1986 was adopted by ISO/IEC under the fast-track procedure as second edition of ISO 6429. It constitutes a repertoire of a large number of control functions the definitions and coded representations of which are thus standardized. For each application the required selection of control functions can be made from this repertoire. This fifth edition of Standard ECMA-48 contains the control functions already standardized in the fourth edition and, in addition, new control functions needed for handling bi-directional texts, i.e. texts comprising parts written with a left-to-right script and parts written with a right-to-left script. ECMA Technical Report TR/53 gives further information and examples of handling such texts. The inclusion of these specialized control functions has required a corresponding adjustment of the definitions of some of the other control functions. Moreover, the concept of "device" had to be revised. This fifth edition has been contributed to ISO/IEC for adoption under the fast-track procedure as third edition of ISO/IEC 6429. Adopted by the General Assembly of ECMA on 13th June 1991.  - i - .

9 Transformation between 7-bit and 8-bit coded representations 74 Annex A - Formator functions and editor functions 77 Annex B - Coding examples 79 Annex C - Text composition considerations 81 Annex D - Implementation-dependent features 83 Annex E - Text area formats 85 Annex F - Differences between the fifth and the fourth edition of ECMA-48 87 - viii - . 1 Scope This ECMA Standard defines control functions and their coded representations for use in a 7-bit code, an extended 7-bit code, an 8-bit code or an extended 8-bit code, if such a code is structured in accordance with Standard ECMA-35. The control functions defined in this Standard are intended to be used embedded in character-coded data for interchange, in particular with character-imaging devices. In general, the control functions are defined by their effects on a character-imaging input/output device. It is, therefore, necessary to make certain assumptions about the architecture of such a device. These assumptions are as unrestrictive as possible; they are specified in clause 6. In addition to being performed the control functions may need to be represented by a graphic symbol. The structure of this Standard is open-ended, so that more control functions can be included in future editions. Other standards specifying control functions may define more restricted definitions of them than those in this Standard. The devices to which this Standard applies can vary greatly from each other depending on the application for which a device has been specifically designed. It is technically and economically impractical for one device to implement all the facilities specified in this Standard. The intention is that in any type of device only a limited selection of the facilities appropriate to the application will be implemented. 2 Conformance 2.1 Types of conformance Full conformance to a standard means that all of its requirements are met. Conformance will only have a unique meaning if the standard contains no options. If there are options within the standard they must be clearly identified, and any claim of conformance must include a statement that identifies those options that have been adopted. This Standard is of a different nature since it specifies a large number of facilities from which different selections may be made to suit individual applications. These selections are not identified in this Standard, but must be identified at the time that a claim of conformance is made. Conformance to such an identified selection is known as limited conformance. 2.2 Conformance of information interchange A CC-data-element within coded information for interchange is in conformance with this Standard if the coded representations of control functions within that CC-data-element satisfy the following conditions:

a) a coded representation of a control function that is specified in this Standard shall always represent that control function;

b) a control function that is specified in this Standard shall always be represented by the coded representation that is specified in this Standard for that control function;

c) any coded representation that is reserved for future standardization by this Standard shall not appear. Coded representations of control functions and modes not specified in this Standard may appear in interchanged information subject to the above conditions (see 5.4, 5.4.1 and 7.4). 2.3 Conformance of devices A device is in conformance with this Standard if it conforms to the requirements of 2.3.1, and either or both 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. Any claim of conformance shall identify the document which contains the description specified in 2.3.1. 2.3.1 Device description A device that conforms to this Standard shall be the subject of a description that: i. identifies, by reference to the clauses of, or to the control functions specified in this Standard, the selection of control functions, the coded representations of which the device can originate or can receive and interpret; ii. identifies the means by which the user may supply the corresponding control functions, or may recognize them, as specified respectively in 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 below. 2.3.2 Originating devices An originating device shall be capable of transmitting within a CC-data-element the coded representations of an identified selection of control functions, and of their parameter values (including mode selection parameters), conforming to this Standard. Such a device shall allow the user to supply any control function that he chooses from among the identified selection for the purpose of transmitting its coded representation over the coding interface. 2.3.3 Receiving devices A receiving device shall be capable of receiving within a CC-data-element and interpreting the coded representations of an identified selection of control functions, and of their parameter values (including mode selection parameters), conforming to this Standard. If the identified selection contains a control sequence for which a default value for a parameter is specified in this Standard, the identified selection shall include the default value both in explicit and in implicit representations. Such a device shall make available to the user any control function that is within the identified selection, and the coded representation of which is received over the coding interface, in such a form that the user can recognize it from among the control functions within the identified selection. 3 References ECMA-6 7-Bit Coded Character Set (1991) ECMA-17 Graphic Representation of the Control Characters of the ECMA 7-Bit Coded Character Set for Information Interchange (1968) ECMA-35 Code Extension Techniques (1985) ECMA-43 8-Bit Code - Structure and Rules (1991) ECMA-94 8-Bit Single-Byte Coded Graphic Character Set - Latin Alphabet No. 1 to No. 4 (1986) ECMA-113 8-Bit Single-Byte Coded Graphic Character Sets - Latin/Cyrillic Alphabet (1988) ECMA-114 8-Bit Single-Byte Coded Graphic Character Sets - Latin/Arabic Alphabet (1986) ECMA-118 8-Bit Single-Byte Coded Character Sets - Latin/Greek Alphabet (1986) ECMA-121 8-Bit Single-Byte Coded Character Sets - Latin/Hebrew Alphabet (1987) ECMA-128 8-Bit Single-Byte Coded Character Sets - Latin Alphabet No. 5 (1988) ECMA-144 8-Bit Single-Byte Coded Character Sets - Latin Alphabet No. 6 (1990) ECMA TR/53 Handling of Bi-directional Texts (1992) ISO 1745:1975 Information processing - Basic mode control procedures for data communication systems ISO 2375:1985 Data processing - Procedure for registration of escape sequences ISO/IEC 7350:1991 Information Technology - Registration of repertoires of graphic characters from ISO/IEC 10367 ISO 8613-6:1989 Information processing - Text and office systems - Office Document Architecture (ODA) and interchange format - Part 6: Character content architectures ISO/IEC 10367:1991 Information Technology - Repertoire of standardized coded graphic character sets for use in 8-bit codes ISO/IEC 10538:1990 Information Technology - Control functions for text communication ISO International Register of Coded Character Sets to be Used with Escape Sequences. 4 Notation and definitions 4.1 Notation In this Standard a convention has been adopted to assist the reader. Capital letters are used to refer to a specific control function, mode, mode setting, or graphic character in order to avoid confusion, for example, between the concept "space" and the character SPACE. It is intended that this convention and the acronyms of the modes and the control functions be retained in all translations of the text. This Standard uses the notation of the form xx/yy, where xx represents the column number 00 to 07 in a 7- bit code table or 00 to 15 in an 8-bit code table, and yy represents the row number 00 to 15. 4.2 Definitions For the purpose of this Standard, the following definitions apply. 4.2.1 Active area The area in the data component which contains the active data position. The area in the presentation component which contains the active presentation position. 4.2.2 Active field The field in the data component which contains the active data position. The field in the presentation component which contains the active presentation position. 4.2.3 Active line The line in the data component which contains the active data position.

a) elements of the C0 set;

b) elements of the C1 set;

c) control sequences;

d) independent control functions;

e) control strings. 5.2 Elements of the C0 set These control functions are represented in 7-bit and 8-bit codes by bit combinations from 00/00 to 01/15. The definitions and the coded representations of the control functions are specified in 8.3 (see also table 1). The 3-character escape sequence designating and invoking this C0 set is ESC 02/01 04/00.

NOTE 1

The use of this escape sequence implies that all control functions of this C0 set must be implemented.

NOTE 2

It is assumed that even with no invoked C0 set the control character ESCAPE is available and is represented by bit combination 01/11. Table 1 - Bit combinations representing the control functions of the C0 set Row number Column number 00 01 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 NUL SOH STX ETX EOT ENQ ACK BEL BS HT LF VT FF CR SO or LS1 SI or LS0 DLE DC1 DC2 DC3 DC4 NAK SYN ETB CAN EM SUB ESC IS4 IS3 IS2 IS1 5.3 Elements of the C1 set These control functions are represented

a) in a 7-bit code by 2-character escape sequences of the form ESC Fe, where ESC is represented by bit combination 01/11 and Fe is represented by a bit combination from 04/00 to 05/15;

b) in an 8-bit code by bit combinations from 08/00 to 09/15; however, when the announcer sequence ESC 02/00 04/06 according to Standard ECMA-35 is used, the control functions of the C1 set are represented by ESC Fe sequences as in a 7-bit code. The definitions and the coded representations of the control functions are specified in 8.3 (see also table 2a and table 2b). The unallocated bit combinations are reserved for future standardization and shall not be used. For the bit combinations 04/04 (see table 2a) and 08/04 (see table 2b) see F.8.2 in annex F. The 3-character escape sequences designating and invoking this C1 set are ESC 02/06 04/00 and ESC 02/02 F.

NOTE 

The use of these escape sequences implies that all control characters of this C1 set must be implemented.

The control function CSI itself is an element of the C1 set. The format of a control sequence is CSI P ... P I ... I F where

a) CSI is represented by bit combinations 01/11 (representing ESC) and 05/11 in a 7-bit code or by bit combination 09/11 in an 8-bit code, see 5.3;

b) P ... P are Parameter Bytes, which, if present, consist of bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/15;

c) I ... I are Intermediate Bytes, which, if present, consist of bit combinations from 02/00 to 02/15. Together with the Final Byte F, they identify the control function;

NOTE 

The number of Intermediate Bytes is not limited by this Standard; in practice, one Intermediate Byte will be sufficient since with sixteen different bit combinations available for the Intermediate Byte over one thousand control functions may be identified.

d) F is the Final Byte; it consists of a bit combination from 04/00 to 07/14; it terminates the control sequence and together with the Intermediate Bytes, if present, identifies the control function. Bit combinations 07/00 to 07/14 are available as Final Bytes of control sequences for private (or experimental) use. The definitions and the coded representations of the control functions are specified in 8.3 (see also tables 3 and 4). Coding examples are shown in B.1 in annex B.

See also F.8.3 in annex F. 5.4.1 Parameter representation A control sequence may contain a string of Parameter Bytes P ... P representing one or more parameters to complete the specification of the control function. The Parameter Bytes are bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/15. The parameter string is interpreted as follows:

a) If the first bit combination of the parameter string is in the range 03/00 to 03/11, the parameter string is interpreted according to the format described in 5.4.2.

b) If the first bit combination of the parameter string is in the range 03/12 to 03/15, the parameter string is available for private (or experimental) use. Its format and meaning are not defined by this Standard. 5.4.2 Parameter string format A parameter string which does not start with a bit combination in the range 03/12 to 03/15 shall have the following format:

a) A parameter string consists of one or more parameter sub-strings, each of which represents a number in decimal notation.

b) Each parameter sub-string consists of one or more bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/10; the bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/09 represent the digits ZERO to NINE; bit combination 03/10 may be used as a separator in a parameter sub-string, for example, to separate the fractional part of a decimal number from the integer part of that number.

c) Parameter sub-strings are separated by one bit combination 03/11.

d) Bit combinations 03/12 to 03/15 are reserved for future standardization except when used as the first bit combination of the parameter string.

e) An empty parameter sub-string represents a default value which depends on the control function.

f) In each parameter sub-string, leading bit combinations 03/00 are not significant and may be omitted. If the parameter sub-string consists of bit combinations 03/00 only, at least one of them must be retained to indicate the zero value of the sub-string.

g) If the parameter string starts with the bit combination 03/11, an empty parameter sub-string is assumed preceding the separator; if the parameter string terminates with the bit combination 03/11, an empty parameter sub-string is assumed following the separator; if the parameter string contains successive bit combinations 03/11, empty parameter sub-strings are assumed between the separators.

h) If the control function has more than one parameter, and some parameter sub-strings are empty, the separators (bit combination 03/11) must still be present. However, if the last parameter sub-string(s) is empty, the separator preceding it may be omitted, see B.2 in annex B. 5.4.3 Types of parameters In a control sequence with parameters, each parameter sub-string corresponds to one parameter and represents the value of that parameter. The number of parameters is either fixed or variable, depending on the control function. If the number of parameters is variable, neither the maximum number of values nor the order in which the corresponding actions are performed are defined by this Standard. A parameter may be purely numeric or it may be selective, i.e. denoting one of a numbered list of actions the control function can perform. In the case of selected parameters a particular parameter value may have the same meaning as a combination of two or more separate values. Unassigned selective parameter values are reserved for future standardization. 5.5 Independent control functions These control functions are represented in 7-bit and 8-bit codes by 2-character escape sequences of the form ESC Fs, where ESC is represented by bit combination 01/11 and Fs is represented by a bit combination from 06/00 to 07/14. The definitions and the coded representations of the control functions are specified in 8.3 (see also table 5). Table 5 - Independent control functions Row number Column number 06 07 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 DMI INT EMI RIS CMD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- LS2 LS3 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- LS3R LS2R LS1R -- The unallocated bit combinations are reserved for future standardization and shall not be used.

NOTE 

ESC Fs sequences are registered in the ISO International Register of Coded Character Sets to be Used with Escape Sequences, which is maintained by the Registration Authority for ISO 2375. Any candidates for ESC Fs sequences have to be approved by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 for registration. The coding for the Final Byte, Fs, will then be assigned by the Registration Authority. 5.6 Control strings A control string is a string of bit combinations which may occur in the data stream as a logical entity for control purposes. A control string consists of an opening delimiter, a command string or a character string, and a terminating delimiter, the STRING TERMINATOR (ST). A command string is a sequence of bit combinations in the range 00/08 to 00/13 and 02/00 to 07/14. A character string is a sequence of any bit combination, except those representing START OF STRING (SOS) or STRING TERMINATOR (ST). The interpretation of the command string or the character string is not defined by this Standard, but instead requires prior agreement between the sender and the recipient of the data. The opening delimiters defined in this Standard are

a) APPLICATION PROGRAM COMMAND (APC)

b) DEVICE CONTROL STRING (DCS)

c) OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND (OSC)

d) PRIVACY MESSAGE (PM)

e) START OF STRING (SOS) 6 Device concepts The definitions of the control functions in this Standard are based on general assumptions about the architecture of a character-imaging device. Examples of devices conforming to these concepts are: an alphanumeric display device, a printer or a microfilm output device. A character-imaging device is a device which is capable of receiving a data stream that consists of coded control functions and graphic characters, and is capable of producing a graphic image output. This output must be readable by a human being according to the various traditional writing conventions such as left-to- right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top. The graphic image output is, in general, produced in the form of one or more rectangular arrays of character positions and lines which are called pages. If the device is an input/output device rather than merely an output device, it is also capable of transmitting a data stream that consists of coded control functions and graphic characters; the transmitted data stream is, in general, composed of a combination of data which have been sent to the device and data which have been entered locally into the device, for example by an associated keyboard. A number of facilities for the organization of the graphic image output and for establishing the direction of presented text are provided by this Standard. A device may support all of these facilities or only a subset of them appropriate to the application. The definitions in this Standard assume a bi-directional device which has both a presentation component (see 6.1.1) and a data component (see 6.1.3). In the case of a uni-directional device or a bi-directional device without a data component, all references to active data position, data component, character progression, etc., are to be read as referring to active presentation position, presentation component, character path, etc., resp. 6.1 Components A device consists either of an input component, a presentation component and a data component, or of an input component and a presentation component only. The input component is capable of receiving the information to be imaged from a manual input device such as a keyboard or from a data stream. This Standard does not deal with the input component. The presentation component which is present in uni-directional as well as in bi-directional devices is used for producing the graphic image output. The output may, for example, be rendered on a display or a printer. The data component which is generally provided in bi-directional devices only is used to store the received information for further presentation processing. 6.1.1 Presentation component The presentation component is capable of presenting the information in successive lines; each line consisting of successive character positions. The lines, as well as the character positions, are identified by the consecutive numbers 1, 2, 3 ... The line orientation in the presentation component is either horizontal or vertical. This defines the way in which a line will appear in the produced graphic image output. For horizontal line orientation, the direction of the line progression can be: top-to-bottom, or             bottom-to-top. For vertical line orientation, the direction of the line progression can be: left-to-right, or right-to-left. The sequential order of the character positions along a line of the presentation component is called the character path. The character path along a line can be: left-to-right or right-to-left (in the case of horizontal line orientation), or top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top (in the case of vertical line orientation). The lines are numbered according to the established line progression. The character positions are numbered according to the established character path. Each character position either is in the erased state or images a graphic symbol. A graphic symbol represents SPACE, a graphic character, or a control function for which a graphical representation is required. The initial state of all character positions is "erased". Depending on the implementation, there may or may not be a distinction between a character position in the erased state and a character position imaging SPACE. 6.1.2 The active presentation position At any time, there is a unique character position in the presentation component which is called the active presentation position. The active presentation position is the character position which is to receive the next graphic character of the data stream for graphic image output or a control function for which a graphical representation is required. The active presentation position in the presentation component is also the character position relative to which certain control functions are to be executed (see 6.4). The active presentation position can be moved explicitly (see 6.1.7) or indirectly (see 6.1.8). In the case where a device has no data component, the active presentation position can also be moved implicitly (see 6.1.6).

NOTE 

In a display it is common practice to mark the active presentation position by means of a special visible indicator which is called the cursor. The line containing the active presentation position is called the active line; the field containing the active presentation position is called the active field; the area containing the active presentation position is called the active area; the page containing the active presentation position is called the active page. 6.1.3 Data component In the data component the received data stream is structured into successive lines; each line consisting of successive character positions. The lines, as well as the character positions, are identified by the consecutive numbers 1, 2, 3 ... The sequential order of the character positions along a line of the data component is called the character progression. In this Standard, the line orientation in the data component is considered to be horizontal, the line progression is considered to be top-to-bottom, the character progression is considered to be left-to-right. The lines are numbered according to the line progression. The character positions are numbered according to the character progression. Each character position either is in the erased state or contains a graphic character, or a control function. The initial state of all character positions is "erased". Depending on the implementation, there may or may not be a distinction between a character position in the erased state and a character position containing SPACE. 6.1.4 The active data position At any time, there is a unique character position in the data component which is called the active data position. The active data position is the character position which is available for the next graphic character or the next control function of the received data stream. The active data position is also the character position relative to which certain control functions are to be executed (see 6.4). The active data position can be moved implicitly (see 6.1.6) or explicitly (see 6.1.7) or indirectly (see 6.1.8). The line containing the active data position is called the active line; the field containing the active data position is called the active field; the area containing the active data position is called the active area; the page containing the active data position is called the active page. 6.1.5 Relationship between active data position and active presentation position In a uni-directional device, whether it has a presentation component only or a presentation component and a data component, there is no difference between the active data position and the active presentation position. In a bi-directional device, if it has a presentation component and a data component, the active presentation position is the character position in the presentation component that corresponds to the active data position in the data component. Because of the possible differences between character progression and character path, as in some bi-directional environments, the coordinates of the active data position in the data component and of the active presentation position in the presentation component may differ. Some control functions act on, and affect, the active data position whereas other control functions act on, and affect, the active presentation position. When one of these positions is so modified, the other is updated accordingly. This is referred to as indirect movement (see 6.1.8). In the situation where a data component is not present in a device then the characteristics of the data component, active data position, active data position movement, character progression, etc., are treated as if they are identical with the respective characteristics of the presentation component, active presentation position, active presentation position movement, character path, etc., resp.. 6.1.6 Implicit movement An implicit movement is a movement of the active data position which is performed after a graphic character is received, or a control function, for which a graphical representation is required. In unidirectional devices the direction of the implicit movement of the active data position in the data component is the same as the direction of the character progression; in devices without a data component the implicit movement applies to the active presentation position in the presentation component and is then the same as the direction of the character path. In bi-directional devices the direction of the implicit movement may be different from the direction of the character progression. The direction is the same as the direction of the character progression until it is modified by an appropriate control function. If the direction of the implicit movement is the same as that of the character progression and the active data position is not the last character position of the active line, the active data position is moved to the following character position of that line. If the direction of the implicit movement is opposite to that of the character progression and the active data position is not the first character position of the active line, the active data position is moved to the preceding character position of that line. When the active data position has been modified by an implicit movement, the active presentation position in the presentation component is updated accordingly; this is referred to as indirect movement (see 6.1.8).

NOTE 

In the following situation, the effect of an attempt to move the active data position is not defined by this Standard: an attempt to perform an implicit movement when the active data position is the last character position of a line and the direction of the implicit movement is the same as that of the character progression, or when the active data position is the first character position of a line and the direction of the implicit movement is opposite to that of the character progression;   Depending on the implementation, an attempt to perform such movements may

a) cause a wrap-around movement;

b) cause the position to be blocked (a condition in which no graphic character can be entered until a valid explicit position movement is performed);

c) cause the position to remain where it is but permit graphic characters to be entered thereby replacing or overstriking the previously entered character;

d) cause the cursor to disappear from the operator's view;

e) cause the cursor to move to the opposite end of the display but one column or row offset;

f) cause scrolling to occur;

g) cause other implementation-dependent action. 6.1.7 Explicit movement In the data component an explicit movement is a movement of the active data position that is performed when a control function is executed which causes the active data position to be moved to a specified character position in the data component. When the active data position has been modified by an explicit movement, the active presentation position in the presentation component is updated accordingly; this is referred to as indirect movement (see 6.1.8). In the presentation component an explicit movement is a movement of the active presentation position that is performed when a control function is executed which causes the active presentation position to be moved to a specified character position in the presentation component. When the active presentation position has been modified by an explicit movement, the active data position in the data component is updated accordingly; this is referred to as indirect movement (see 6.1.8).

NOTE 

In the following situation, the effect of an attempt to move the active data position or the active presentation position is not defined by this Standard: an attempt to perform an explicit movement to a non-existing character position, for example beyond the last character position of a line, or beyond the last line of a page.   Depending on the implementation, an attempt to perform such movements may

a) cause a wrap-around movement;

b) cause the position to be blocked (a condition in which no graphic character can be entered until a valid explicit position movement is performed);

c) cause the position to remain where it is but permit graphic characters to be entered thereby replacing or overstriking the previously entered character;

d) cause the cursor to disappear from the operator's view;

e) cause the cursor to move to the opposite end of the display but one column or row offset;

f) cause scrolling to occur;

g) cause other implementation-dependent action. 6.1.8 Indirect movement In the data component an indirect movement is the movement by which the active data position is modified to reflect a modification of the active presentation position by an explicit movement (see 6.1.7) in the presentation component. In the presentation component an indirect movement is the movement by which the active presentation position is modified to reflect a modification of the active data position by an implicit movement (see 6.1.6) or by an explicit movement (see 6.1.7) in the data component. 6.2 The data stream The data stream is considered to be a continuous stream. It may be structured in messages, records and/or blocks, but this does not affect the operation of the devices at the abstract level of description in this Standard; the logical or physical units of data are regarded as being concatenated to form one continuous data stream. 6.2.1 Data organization Text within a data stream can be viewed as being constructed from character strings. Each such string may contain nested strings. Characters within a string are organized in the order in which they are intended to be read. Each string has a direction associated with it. The direction may be associated with the string using a control function or a higher-level protocol. If the direction is not determined in this way, then the direction is the same as that of the currently established character path. 6.3 The graphic image output In this Standard, the graphic image output is regarded as being produced in the form of a continuous stream, but it may eventually be made available character-by-character, line-by-line, or page-by-page. The graphic image output may consist of one or more pages of a predetermined size. A page is composed of a predetermined number of lines, each composed of a predetermined number of character positions. During the operation of the device, the number of lines per page, the number of character positions per line, the line spacing, and the character spacing may be changed by appropriate control functions. The graphic image output is constructed in the presentation component from the data stream stored in the data component, and according to the line orientation and line progression of the presentation component. The presentation of characters along a line in the presentation component is dependent on the character path, the character progression and the direction associated with the string. The size of a character position may be fixed or may depend on the graphic symbol of the character being imaged. The font design of the graphic symbols is not defined by this Standard. 6.4 Formator functions and editor functions Two classes of control functions have an action on the layout or positioning of information in characterimaging devices. They are formator functions and editor functions. The principal difference between editor functions and formator functions is that the latter are sensitive to the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM); whereas the former are not (see annex A). 6.4.1 Formator functions They are format effectors and presentation control functions. Formator functions may be part of the data stream. They describe how the originator of the data stream wishes the information to be formatted or presented. Therefore, if formator functions are not stored by the receiving device they shall be regenerated by the device for subsequent transmission to additional recipients in order to preserve data integrity. In uni-directional devices the active presentation position (or the active line, where applicable) is the reference position against which formator functions are performed. In bi-directional devices certain formator functions are performed against the active data position (or the active line, where applicable) in the data component, dependent on the setting of the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM). Formator functions are processed depending on the setting of the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM) of the device. 6.4.2 Composite graphic characters Composite graphic characters may be obtained by using formator functions only; editor functions shall not be used for this purpose (see A.2 in annex A). 6.4.3 Editor functions The main purpose of editor functions is to edit, alter or transpose the visual arrangement of data. Editor functions are performed immediately and do not become part of the data stream. In uni-directional devices the active presentation position (or the active line, where applicable) is the reference position against which editor functions are performed. In bi-directional devices certain editor functions are performed against the active data position (or the active line, where applicable) in the data component, depending on the setting of the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM). 6.5 Selected and qualified areas This clause is applicable primarily to buffered input/output devices. It may also be applicable to unbuffered input/output devices when the SEND/RECEIVE MODE (SRM) is set to SIMULTANEOUS. 6.5.1 Selected areas A selected area is a string of character positions in the presentation component, the contents of which may be eligible (see 7.3.1) to be transmitted in the form of a data stream or to be transferred to an auxiliary input/output device (see 6.6). The beginning of a selected area is established by START OF SELECTED AREA (SSA). The character position in the presentation component which is the active presentation position after the receipt of SSA is the first character position of the selected area. The end of a selected area is established by END OF SELECTED AREA (ESA). The character position in the presentation component which is the active presentation position before the receipt of ESA is the last character position of the selected area. The character positions in a line of a selected area are ordered according to the character path of this line. 6.5.2 Qualified areas A qualified area is a string of character positions in the presentation component with which certain characteristics are associated, such as one or a combination of the following:

a) the contents are protected against manual alteration;

b) the kind of characters which are permitted to be entered is restricted (for example, to numeric or alphabetic characters only);

c) the contents are protected against erasure;

d) a tabulation stop is associated with the first character position;

e) the contents are to be excluded, i.e. guarded (see 6.5.2.2) from transmission as a data stream, or from transfer to an auxiliary input/output device (see 6.6). The beginning of a qualified area is established by DEFINE AREA QUALIFICATION (DAQ). The character position in the presentation component which is the active presentation position after receipt of DAQ is the first character position of the qualified area. The type of area qualification is specified by the parameter value of DAQ. The end of a qualified area is established by the beginning of the following qualified area. The order of the character positions in a line of a qualified area can be the same as, or opposite to, the character path of this line. 6.5.2.1 Protected areas A protected area is a special case of a qualified area. It is a string of character positions, the contents of which are protected against manual alteration and may also be protected against erasure depending on the setting of the ERASURE MODE (ERM). A protected area may, in general, be either guarded or unguarded. 6.5.2.2 Guarded areas A guarded area is a special case of a qualified area. It is a protected area the contents of which are excluded from transmission as a data stream and from transfer to an auxiliary input/output device, depending on the setting of the GUARDED AREA TRANSFER MODE (GATM). Alternatively to using DEFINE AREA QUALIFICATION (DAQ), START OF GUARDED AREA (SPA) combined with END OF GUARDED AREA (EPA) can be used. The start of a guarded area is then established by START OF GUARDED AREA (SPA). The end of the guarded area is then established by END OF GUARDED AREA (EPA). The character position which is the active presentation position after receipt of SPA is the first character position of the guarded area. The character position which is the active presentation position before the receipt of EPA is the last character position of the guarded area.

NOTE 

Interaction between guarded areas established by SPA and EPA, and those established by DAQ is not defined by this Standard. 6.6 Auxiliary input/output devices This clause is applicable primarily to buffered input/output devices. It may also be applicable to unbuffered input/output devices when the SEND/RECEIVE MODE (SRM) is set to SIMULTANEOUS. Data transfer from, or to, an auxiliary input/output device is initiated either by the operation of an appropriate key on a keyboard or by the control function MEDIA COPY (MC) appearing in the received data stream. If there is more than one auxiliary input/output device, the relevant device is specified by the parameter value of MC. An input data stream which is received from an auxiliary device is processed in the same way as any other received data stream. The method of terminating the input from the auxiliary device depends on the implementation. 6.7 Tabulation and fields Tabulation is the technique of identifying character positions or lines, as related to the presentation component, for the purpose of arranging information systematically. A character position or a line which is identified for tabulation is indicated by a tabulation stop. Tabulation stops in the presentation component introduce fields and act as boundaries between fields. The field is defined as a string of character positions starting at the position of the character tabulation stop (beginning of the field) up to, but not including, the position of the following character tabulation stop (end of the field). The order of character positions within the field as well as the order of tabulation stops within a line in the presentation component is determined by the character path of this line. A character tabulation stop is assigned to a character position by the control functions CURSOR TABULATION CONTROL (CTC), CHARACTER TABULATION SET (HTS), TABULATION ALIGNED CENTRED (TAC), TABULATION ALIGNED LEADING EDGE (TALE), TABULATION ALIGNED TRAILING EDGE (TATE), TABULATION CENTRED ON CHARACTER (TCC). A line tabulation stop is assigned to a line by the control function LINE TABULATION SET (VTS). 7 Modes 7.1 The concept of modes This Standard is intended to be applicable to a very large range of devices, in which there are variations. Some of these variations have been formalized in the form of modes. They deal with the way in which a device transmits, receives, processes, or images data. Each mode has two states. The reset state is shown first in the definitions in 7.2. The states of the modes may be established explicitly in the data stream by the control functions SET MODE (SM) and RESET MODE (RM) or may be established by agreement between sender and recipient. In an implementation, some or all of the modes may have one state only. To ensure data compatibility and ease of interchange with a variety of equipment the use of modes is deprecated. If modes have to be implemented for backward compatibility it is recommended that the reset state of the modes be the initial state. Otherwise, explicit agreements will have to be negotiated between sender and recipient, to the detriment of "blind" interchange. 7.2 Definition of modes The modes are set and reset by the control functions SET MODE (SM) and RESET MODE (RM). The parameters of SM or RM specify the modes which are affected. In each of the mode definitions below, the first state is caused by RM, the second one by SM. The modes are listed in the alphabetical order of their acronyms. It is intended that the acronyms be retained in all translations of the text. See also table 6.

In the case of a uni-directional device or a bi-directional device without a data component, all references to active data position, data component, character progression, etc., are to be read as referring to active presentation position, presentation component, character path, etc., resp. 7.2.1 BDSM - BI-DIRECTIONAL SUPPORT MODE EXPLICIT: Control functions are performed in the data component or in the presentation component, depending on the setting of the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM). IMPLICIT: Control functions are performed in the data component. All bi-directional aspects of data are handled by the device itself. 7.2.2 CRM - CONTROL REPRESENTATION MODE CONTROL: All control functions are performed as defined; the way formator functions are processed depends on the setting of the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM). A device may choose to image the graphical representations of control functions in addition to performing them.

Any graphic rendition aspects that are to remain unchanged after an occurrence of SGR have to be re-specified by that SGR. CUMULATIVE: Each occurrence of the control function SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION (SGR) causes only those graphic rendition aspects to be changed that are specified by that SGR. All other graphic rendition aspects remain unchanged.

NOTE

If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA, a character insertion causes the contents of the active data position and of the following character positions in the data component to be shifted in the direction of the character progression; a character deletion causes the contents of the character positions following the active data position to be shifted in the direction opposite to that of the character progression. PRECEDING: If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to PRESENTATION, a character insertion causes the contents of the active presentation position and of the following character positions in the presentation component to be shifted in the direction opposite to that of the character path; a character deletion causes the contents of the character positions following the active presentation position to be shifted in the direction of the character path. If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA, a character insertion causes the contents of the active data position and of preceding character positions in the data component to be shifted in the direction opposite to that of the character progression; a character deletion causes the contents of the character positions preceding the active data position to be shifted in the direction of the character progression.

If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA, a line insertion causes the contents of the active line (the line that contains the active data position) and of the following lines in the data component to be shifted in the direction of the line progression; a line deletion causes the contents of the lines following the active line to be shifted in the direction opposite to that of the line progression. PRECEDING: If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to PRESENTATION, a line insertion causes the contents of the active line (the line that contains the active presentation position) and of the preceding lines to be shifted in the direction opposite to that of the line progression; a line deletion causes the contents of the lines preceding the active line to be shifted in the direction of the line progression. If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA, a line insertion causes the contents of the active line (the line that contains the active data position) and of the preceding lines to be shifted in the direction opposite to that of the line progression; a line deletion causes the contents of the lines preceding the active line to be shifted in the direction of the line progression.

NOTE 

Control functions affected are: DL, IL. 7.2.20 ZDM - ZERO DEFAULT MODE See F.4.2 in annex F. 7.3 Interaction between modes Four groups of modes are specified below. Each group contains two or more modes which interact with one another.

b) CONTROL REPRESENTATION MODE (CRM), and FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM)

c) CHARACTER EDITING MODE (HEM), and INSERTION REPLACEMENT MODE (IRM)

d) BI-DIRECTIONAL SUPPORT MODE (BDSM), and DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) 7.3.1 GUARDED AREA TRANSFER MODE (GATM), MULTIPLE AREA TRANSFER MODE (MATM), SELECTED AREA TRANSFER MODE (SATM), and TRANSFER TERMINATION MODE (TTM) These modes have a combined effect on the format of a transmitted data stream or of a data stream transferred to an auxiliary input/output device, as described hereafter. The term "active selected area" is used to denote the selected area in the presentation component containing the active presentation position. The term "eligible" is used for denoting any area which may be considered for transmitting or transferring.

a) If the TTM is set to CURSOR, the SATM to SELECT, and the MATM to SINGLE, then the contents of the active selected area, up to but excluding the active presentation position, are eligible.

b) If the TTM is set to CURSOR, the SATM to SELECT, and the MATM to MULTIPLE, then the contents of any selected area, up to but excluding the active presentation position, are eligible.

c) If the TTM is set to CURSOR and the SATM to ALL, then the contents of the buffer up to but excluding the active presentation position, are eligible.

d) If the TTM is set to ALL, the SATM to SELECT, and the MATM to SINGLE, then the complete contents of the active selected area are eligible.

e) If the TTM is set to ALL, the SATM to SELECT, and the MATM to MULTIPLE, then the complete contents of all selected areas are eligible.

f) If the TTM and the SATM are both set to ALL, then the complete contents of the buffer are eligible.

g) If the GATM is set to GUARD, the contents of the eligible area or areas are transmitted or transferred, except for the contents of guarded areas which are completely contained within an eligible area. In the case where a guarded area is only partly contained within an eligible area, the contents of the part contained in the eligible area may be transmitted or not, depending on the implementation.

h) If the GATM is set to ALL, guarded as well as unguarded data in an eligible area are transmitted or transferred. If the active presentation position is not within a selected area, the format of the data stream in the first and fourth case above is not defined by this Standard. 7.3.2 CONTROL REPRESENTATION MODE (CRM) and FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM)

a) If the CRM is set to CONTROL, and the FEAM is set to EXECUTE, all control functions are performed as defined.

b) If the CRM is set to CONTROL, and the FEAM is set to STORE, formator functions are treated as graphic characters.

c) If the CRM is set to GRAPHIC, all control functions except RM are treated as graphic characters. 7.3.3 CHARACTER EDITING MODE (HEM) and INSERTION REPLACEMENT MODE (IRM)

a) If the IRM is set to REPLACE, the HEM influences the control functions DELETE CHARACTER (DCH) and INSERT CHARACTER (ICH) only.

b) If the IRM is set to INSERT, then, in addition, the effect of the receipt of a graphic character or a control function for which a graphical representation is required, depends on the setting of the HEM. If the HEM is set to FOLLOWING, the implicit movement of the active position is performed normally; if it is set to PRECEDING, the active position does not move. Whether the active position referred to above is the active data position in the data component or the active presentation position in the presentation component, depends on the setting of the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM). 7.3.4 BI-DIRECTIONAL SUPPORT MODE (BDSM) and DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM)

a) If the BDSM is set to EXPLICIT and the DCSM is set to DATA, certain control functions are performed in the data component.

b) If the BDSM is set to EXPLICIT and the DCSM is set to PRESENTATION, certain control functions are performed in the presentation component.

NOTE 

Control functions affected are: CPR, CR, DCH, DL, EA, ECH, ED, EF, EL, ICH, IL , LF, NEL, RI, SLH, SLL, SPH, SPL.

c) If the BDSM is set to IMPLICIT, all relevant control functions are performed in the data component; all bi-directional aspects of the data are handled by the device itself. The setting of the DCSM has no effect; it is considered to be set to DATA (the reset state). 7.4 Private modes A device may implement modes other than those specified in 7.2. Such modes are called Private Modes. See SET MODE (SM) and RESET MODE (RM). The reset state of a private mode shall permit the selection of coded representations of control functions (including parameters for control of modes) that are identified in accordance with 2.3.1 to have the meanings specified in this Standard. 




8 Control functions

8.1 Types of control functions 

This Standard provides for four types of control functions:

a) Control functions that are elements of the C0 set

b) Control functions that are elements of the C1 set

c) Control sequences

d) Independent control functions, represented either - by ESC Fs
sequences, or - by ESC 02/03 F sequences. 

There are also several different forms of control sequences, viz. with
parameters or with no parameter. The notations used for the different
types of control functions and for the different forms of control
sequences are shown below. They are used in the definitions of the
control functions in clause 8.3, and in the listing of control
function categories in clause 8.2. For independent control functions
of the type ESC 02/03 F no notation is indicated as it is not expected
that they will be included in this Standard.

a) (C0): Element of the C0 set

b) (C1): Element of the C1 set

c) (NP): Control sequence with no parameter (see F.9 in annex F) 

d) (Pn): Control sequence with a single numeric parameter

e) (Pn1;Pn2): Control sequence with two numeric parameters

f) (Pn...): Control sequence with any number of numeric parameters

g) (Ps): Control sequence with a single selective parameter

h) (Ps1;Ps2): Control sequence with two selective parameters

i) (Ps...): Control sequence with any number of selective parameters

j) (Fs): Independent control function, represented by an ESC Fs sequence


8.2 Categories of control functions

8.3 Definition of control functions 

The control functions are listed in the alphabetical order of their
acronyms. It is intended that the acronyms be retained in all
translations of the text. The definitions of the control functions
cover bi-directional devices which have both a presentation component
(see 6.1.1) and a data component (see 6.1.3). In the case of a
uni-directional device or a bidirectional device without a data
component, all references to active data position, data component,
character progression, etc., are to be read as referring to active
presentation position, presentation component, character path, etc.,
resp. This also means that the use of the control functions in
implementations of earlier versions of this Standard is not affected
by the inclusion of bi-directional capabilities in the Standard.

The resulting gap is closed by shifting the contents of the adjacent character positions towards the active presentation position. At the other end of the shifted part, n character positions are put into the erased state. The extent of the shifted part is established by SELECT EDITING EXTENT (SEE). The effect of DCH on the start or end of a selected area, the start or end of a qualified area, or a tabulation stop in the shifted part is not defined by this Standard. If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA, DCH causes the contents of the active data position and, depending on the setting of the CHARACTER EDITING MODE (HEM), the contents of the n-1 preceding or following character positions to be removed from the data component, where n equals the value of Pn. The resulting gap is closed by shifting the contents of the adjacent character positions towards the active data position. At the other end of the shifted part, n character positions are put into the erased state.


8.3.27 DCS - DEVICE CONTROL STRING

Notation: (C1)

Representation: 09/00 or ESC 05/00

8.3.99 PTX - PARALLEL TEXTS

Notation: (Ps)

Representation: CSI Ps 05/12

Parameter default value: Ps = 0

Description: PTX is used to delimit strings of graphic characters that are communicated one after another in the data stream but that are intended to be presented in parallel with one another, usually in adjacent lines. The parameter values are

0 end of parallel texts

1 beginning of a string of principal parallel text

2 beginning of a string of supplementary parallel text

3 beginning of a string of supplementary Japanese phonetic annotation

4 beginning of a string of supplementary Chinese phonetic annotation

5 end of a string of supplementary phonetic annotations 

PTX with a parameter value of 1 indicates the beginning of the string of principal text intended to be presented in parallel with one or more strings of supplementary text. PTX with a parameter value of 2, 3 or 4 indicates the beginning of a string of supplementary text that is intended to be presented in parallel with either a string of principal text or the immediately preceding string of supplementary text, if any; at the same time it indicates the end of the preceding string of principal text or of the immediately preceding string of supplementary text, if any. The end of a string of supplementary text is indicated by a subsequent occurrence of PTX with a parameter value other than 1. PTX with a parameter value of 0 indicates the end of the strings of text intended to be presented in parallel with one another.

Selectors: (end begin-principal begin-supplementary begin-supplementary-japanese begin-supplementary-chinese end-supplementary)


Note: PTX does not explicitly specify the relative placement of the strings of principal and supplementary parallel texts, or the relative sizes of graphic characters in the strings of parallel text. A string of supplementary text is normally presented in a line adjacent to the line containing the string of principal text, or adjacent to the line containing the immediately preceding string of supplementary text, if any. The first graphic character of the string of principal text and the first graphic character of a string of supplementary text are normally presented in the same position of their respective lines. However, a string of supplementary text longer (when presented) than the associated string of principal text may be centred on that string. In the case of long strings of text, such as paragraphs in different languages, the strings may be presented in successive lines in parallel columns, with their beginnings aligned with one another and the shorter of the paragraphs followed by an appropriate amount of "white space". Japanese phonetic annotation typically consists of a few half-size or smaller Kana characters which indicate the pronunciation or interpretation of one or more Kanji characters and are presented above those Kanji characters if the character path is horizontal, or to the right of them if the character path is vertical. Chinese phonetic annotation typically consists of a few Pinyin characters which indicate the pronunciation of one or more Hanzi characters and are presented above those Hanzi characters. Alternatively, the Pinyin characters may be presented in the same line as the Hanzi characters and following the respective Hanzi characters. The Pinyin characters will then be presented within enclosing pairs of parentheses.

This direction may be different from that currently established. The indicated string follows the preceding text. The established character progression is not affected. The beginning of a directed string is indicated by SDS with a parameter value not equal to 0. A directed string may contain one or more nested strings. These nested strings may be directed strings the beginnings of which are indicated by SDS with a parameter value not equal to 0, or reversed strings the beginnings of which are indicated by START REVERSED STRING (SRS) with a parameter value of 1. Every beginning of such a string invokes the next deeper level of nesting. This Standard does not define the location of the active data position within any such nested string. The end of a directed string is indicated by SDS with a parameter value of 0. Every end of such a string re-establishes the next higher level of nesting (the one in effect prior to the string just ended). The direction is re-established to that in effect prior to the string just ended. The active data position is moved to the character position following the characters of the string just ended. The parameter values are: 0 end of a directed string; re-establish the previous direction 1 start of a directed string; establish the direction left-to-right 2 start of a directed string; establish the direction right-to-left

Parameter default value: Ps = 0

Description: SRS is used to establish in the data component the beginning and the end of a string of characters as well as the direction of the string. This direction is opposite to that currently established. The indicated string follows the preceding text. The established character progression is not affected.

These nested strings may be reversed strings the beginnings of which are indicated by SRS with a parameter value of 1, or directed strings the beginnings of which are indicated by START DIRECTED STRING (SDS) with a parameter value not equal to 0. Every beginning of such a string invokes the next deeper level of nesting. This Standard does not define the location of the active data position within any such nested string. The end of a reversed string is indicated by SRS with a parameter value of 0. Every end of such a string re-establishes the next higher level of nesting (the one in effect prior to the string just ended).

9 Transformation between 7-bit and 8-bit coded representations 

The control functions defined in this Standard can be coded in a 7-bit
code as well as in an 8-bit code; both forms of coded representation
are equivalent and in accordance with Standard ECMA-35. However, when
data containing these control functions are transformed from a 7-bit
to an 8-bit coded representation or vice versa, the transformation
algorithm specified in Standard ECMA-35 may produce results which are
formally in disagreement with this Standard. In order to make
allowance for such unintended but unavoidable deviations, the formal
rules are extended in the manner described below.

In an 8-bit code, the bit combinations of columns 10 to 15 are permitted to represent Parameter Bytes, Intermediate Bytes, and Final Bytes of a control sequence     the contents of the command string or the character string as part of a control string (see 5.6) the operand of a single-shift control function.         In these situations, the bit combinations in the range 10/00 to 15/14 shall have the same meanings as the corresponding bit combinations in the range 02/00 to 07/14. In a 7-bit code, the control functions SHIFT-OUT (SO) and SHIFT-IN (SI) are permitted to occur between the CONTROL SEQUENCE INTRODUCER (CSI) and the Final Byte of a control sequence, between the opening delimiter of a control string and the STRING TERMINATOR (ST), between a single-shift control function and its operand. SO and SI have no effect on the interpretation of a control sequence, a control string or the operand of a single-shift control function, but they may, indeed, affect the meanings of bit combinations following in the data stream. Annex A (informative) Formator functions and editor functions A.1 Differences between editor functions and formator functions The contrast between editor functions and formator functions, together with their interaction with certain modes, is illustrated by the following example of the use of the control functions CURSOR NEXT LINE (CNL) and NEXT LINE (NEL). In the example it is assumed that the direction of the character path is from left to right and the direction of the line progression is from top to bottom. Furthermore, it is assumed that the string of capital letters A B C D E F has been entered or received, and that the active presentation position has been moved back to the letter D, for example, by means of CURSOR LEFT (CUB). Starting from this situation, the following cases are considered:

a) A CURSOR NEXT LINE (CNL) is received. In this case, the active presentation position is moved to the beginning of the next line without affecting the previously received data.

b) With the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM) set to EXECUTE, a NEXT LINE (NEL) is received. This has the same effect as in case a).

c) With the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM) set to STORE and the INSERTION REPLACEMENT MODE (IRM) set to REPLACE, a NEXT LINE (NEL) is received. In this case, the letter D is replaced by NEL. If the data is subsequently forwarded to another device operating with the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM) set to EXECUTE, the effect is: A B C E F

d) With the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM) set to STORE and the INSERTION REPLACEMENT MODE (IRM) set to INSERT, a NEXT LINE (NEL) is received. In this case, the NEL is inserted between the letters C and D. If the data is subsequently forwarded to another device operating with the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM) set to EXECUTE, the effect is: A B C D E F Formator functions which have been received while the FORMAT EFFECTOR ACTION MODE (FEAM) is set to STORE can be operated upon with editor functions. For example, the NEL which has been inserted between A B C and D E F in case

d) can be deleted using DELETE CHARACTER (DCH), resulting in the initial situation being restored. A.2 Composite graphic characters Because the formator functions can be stored in a receiving device, as opposed to the editor functions which are immediately performed, formator functions may be used but editor functions shall not be used for the construction of composite graphic characters. For example, if the symbol = is to be composed using = (EQUALS SIGN) and / (SOLIDUS), the sequence: = CUB / does not produce the desired effect if received by a device which has no overstrike capability. Such a device may, however, process the sequence: = BS / in such a way that it is preserved and can be forwarded to a device which can indeed produce the intended composite symbol. This example serves only the purpose of illustrating the difference between the effects of editor and formator functions. Where two or more graphic characters are to be imaged by a single graphic symbol, this should be done by using the control function GRAPHIC CHARACTER COMBINATION (GCC). Annex B (informative) Coding examples B.1 Examples of complete control sequences The general format of a control sequence is: CSI P ... P I ... I F In an 8-bit environment the control function CURSOR RIGHT (CUF) by one position can be represented by 09/11 03/01 04/03 or 01/11 05/11 03/01 04/03. Other examples are 09/11 03/00 03/01 04/03 09/11 04/03 The first example shows that leading ZEROs (03/00) are not significant. The second example uses the fact that a default value for CUF is defined and is equal to 1. In a 7-bit environment the representation is 01/11 05/11 03/01 04/03 The representation of the two examples above is then 01/11 05/11 03/00 03/01 04/03 01/11 05/11 04/03 In an 8-bit environment the control function SCROLL RIGHT (SR) by 28 positions can be represented for instance by 09/11 03/02 03/08 02/00 04/01 or 01/11 05/11 03/02 03/08 02/00 04/01 In a 7-bit environment the corresponding representation is 01/11 05/11 03/02 03/08 02/00 04/01 In an 8-bit environment the control function DEFINE AREA QUALIFICATION (DAQ) permitting numeric and alphabetic data to be entered into an input area can be represented by 09/11 03/03 03/11 03/04 06/15 or 01/11 05/11 03/03 03/11 03/04 06/15 In a 7-bit environment the corresponding representation is 01/11 05/11 03/03 03/11 03/04 06/15 B.2 Examples of parameter strings Character Bit combination Explanation 7 03/07 A parameter having the value 7. 98 03/09 03/08 A parameter having the value 98. 4;2 03/04 03/11 03/08 Two parameters having the values 4 and 2, respectively. =3 03/13 03/03 A private parameter string. 6; 03/06 03/11 Two parameters, the first having the value 6 and the second taking the default value.

Annex C (informative) Text composition considerations Display devices and systems involving text composition may use the control functions JUSTIFY (JFY) and QUAD (QUAD). When working in the field of text composition several words are used with quite specialized meaning. Those words have been used in this Standard with the meaning from the technology of the printing and publishing industry. Explanation is provided in this annex in terms compatible with coded information interchange and the concepts of character-imaging devices. Both QUAD and JFY deal with the positioning of text (graphic characters and free spaces) between "margins". Margins are areas protected against display at the boundaries of which lines of text may start and terminate. In the general case of a display device with a multiple-page buffer (capable of the QUAD or JFY functions) the margin(s) would be set at arbitrary absolute character positions. The QUAD function deals with single lines of text from the data stream, while the JFY function may deal with more than one line. In both cases it is possible to "flush" text. When text is flush, it starts or ends, as applicable, against a marginal boundary. Flush to line home position margin means start text at the appropriate margin (or first margin line home position in columnar texts). Similarly, flush to line limit position margin means to end text at that appropriate margin. In the process of making text flush, open spaces may be generated. The action to "fill" open spaces involves a concept particular to the JFY and QUAD functions. The open spaces may be filled with a "leader" in the QUAD function. A leader is a pattern (most often a repeated string of graphic characters) which is inserted into the open area. In the use of the JFY function the fill operation is more complicated and will be described below. Having considered margins and flush text it is necessary to consider text which is not intended to be flush to the margins. Text which meets this criterion falls into two classes. They are "centred" text and "ragged" text. This Standard deals explicitly with ragged text. Centred text is arranged between margins such that the open space to the line home position margin and to the line limit position margin are as equal as possible. Ragged is the term applied when text is neither centred nor flush to a margin. The process using the JFY function involves the arrangement of text between margins either being flush (explicitly) or ragged (implicitly). In order to accomplish flush to line home position margin and to line limit position margin, "fill" may be required. The fill may consist of spaces of different width, words, or parts of words. For the purpose of this description a word is considered as including the graphic characters of the word itself and the punctuation mark or SPACE terminating the word. The rules regarding a specific justification process depend on the combination of the parameter values used. A line which is to be justified to line home position margin and line limit position margin with word fill will first be adjusted in length by the addition or removal of text in the form of words until the remaining words fit between the established margins. Words added to a line by such a process will be obtained from the data stream from its following line(s). Words removed from the line will be returned to the data stream in its following lines. Subsequent to having sufficient words to fit between margins the open spaces (between words or graphic characters) may be adjusted to accomplish the combined flush-to-line home position margin and flush-to-line limit position margin action. This spacing is adjusted by intervals, or variable-size spaces according to the implementation. When the word space parameter value has been used the spacing adjustment occurs between words. When the letter space parameter value has been used the spacing adjustment occurs between adjacent graphic characters. When both word space and letter space parameter values have been used the strategy for selecting which spacings are to be adjusted is implementation-dependent. Special cases of the above involve the use of partial words in the fill process. In these cases a hyphenation process is used. If the hyphenation parameter value is used, words may be subdivided according to an implementation strategy at language intervals, often corresponding to syllables. If the Italian hyphenation parameter value is used the first word which will not fit between the margins is truncated, the last character of the line is underlined and the remainder of the word is inserted in the data stream for use in the next line. Annex D (informative) Implementation-dependent features The following introduces, but does not exhaustively list those matters left to the implementors. 1) The control functions which will be selected for implementation. 2) The number of bits, number of characters, and form of the bit combination or bit combinations generated by a single or multiple key depression. 3) Whether characters entered become immediately visible or are processed (partially or fully) prior to becoming visible. 4) If there is a buffer, whether it has a capacity larger than, identical with, or smaller than, the display area. 5) Whether a control function occupies buffer space, display space or both. 6) At what point(s) in the processing of the data stream control functions are to be executed. 7) What the representation of an erased state may be. 8) Whether certain control sequences remain in their encoded state or are transformed into data in special registers and tables. 9) Whether or not there are implementation-defined values for parametric functions when the Standard does not specify a standardized default value. 10) What action will be taken in error recovery. 11) The initial state of a device upon power-up, including the settings of the modes. 12) Whether the width of a displayed character position is fixed or variable (depending on the character occupying the position). 13) The action to be taken by a device if a control function or a graphic character is received which the device cannot implement, because of design limitation or temporary functional disablement. 14) Whether a change of the setting of the CONTROL REPRESENTATION MODE (CRM) affects the appearance of control functions already entered into, or received by, the device or whether only those control functions are affected that are entered or received subsequently. 15) Whether or not the characters in that part of a guarded area which is contained in an eligible area are transmitted or transferred. Annex E (informative) Text area formats E.1 General The purpose of this annex is to provide supplementary information for the control function PAGE FORMAT SELECTION (PFS) defined in 8.3.91. E.2 Dimension of the text area Table E.1 shows the dimensions of the text area corresponding to various values of the parameter of PFS.

NOTE 1

When determining the number of lines per page for the parameter values 0 to 9, account is taken of any additional space needed for an optional "call identification line" (see CCITT Rec. T.60). This space is not included in the text area.

NOTE 2

This annex does not specify the number of lines per page for line spacings of 6 per 30,0 mm used in conjunction with the North American page formats, or for line spacings of 2 or 12 lines per 25,4 mm or 3, 4 of 12 lines per 30,0 mm used in conjunction with any of the page formats.

NOTE 3

This annex does not specify the number of characters per line for spacings of 10 or 15 characters per 25,4 mm used in conjunction with page formats specified by PFS with parameter values 10 to 15, or for spacings of 3 characters per 25,4 mm used in conjunction with the page formats specified by PFS with parameter values 0 to 9. E.3 Line home position For the page formats specified by PFS with parameter values 0 to 9, the line home position is, depending on the character spacing, 6 characters per 25,4 mm: the 4th character position of each line; 10 characters per 25,4 mm: the 6th character position of each line; 12 characters per 25,4 mm: the 7th character position of each line; 15 characters per 25,4 mm: the 8th character position of each line.

NOTE 

For the page formats specified by PFS with parameter values 0 to 9, the line home position is specified so as to provide a margin of approximately 20 mm between the line home position and the edge of the paper. For the page formats specified by PFS with parameter values 10 to 15, the line home position is, depending on the character spacing, 3 characters per 25,4 mm: the 3rd character position of each line; 6 characters per 25,4 mm: the 5th character position of each line; 12 characters per 25,4 mm: the 9th character position of each line.

NOTE 

For the page formats specified by PFS with parameter values 10 to 15, the line home position is specified so as to provide a margin of approximately 25 mm between the line home position and the edge of the paper.

Also editorial improvements have been made like the cancellation of unnecessary repeated references. The elimination of the Latin script bias was already done in the fourth Edition, where some of the terms like "horizontal" and "vertical" or "up" and "down" have been replaced by terms like "character" and "line" or "backward" and "forward". As the acronyms could not be changed because they were already widely implemented and referenced in other standards, some of them are not really acronyms any more, like VPR for LINE POSITION FORWARD (used to be VERTICAL POSITION RELATIVE) or PLU for PARTIAL LINE BACKWARD (used to be PARTIAL LINE UP). The main technical additions concern modes and control functions for handling bi-directional texts and text communication. The main cancellations concern the modes and control functions listed in annex E of the fourth Edition the use of which was already then deprecated. As almost all parts of the text of this version were modified in one way or the other compared to the former version of this Standard, the Editor has refrained from putting change bars in the margins. F.2 Device concepts Clause 6 on device concepts has been entirely revised in order to cope with the specific requirements for bidirectional texts. F.3 New modes Two new modes, the BI-DIRECTIONAL SUPPORT MODE (BDSM) and the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) have been introduced. F.4 Deprecated modes The use of the POSITIONING UNIT MODE (PUM) and the ZERO DEFAULT MODE (ZDM) is deprecated. Their specifications have been moved from the main text to this annex. F.4.1 PUM - Positioning unit mode CHARACTER: The unit for numeric parameters of the positioning format effectors is one character position. SIZE: The unit for numeric parameters of the positioning format effectors is that established by the parameter value of SELECT SIZE UNIT (SSU).

NOTE 1

Control functions affected are: CUB, CUD, CUF, CUU, HPA, HPB, HPR, HVP, SLH, SLL, SSU, VPA, VPB, VPR..

NOTE 2

As the default parameter value of the control function SELECT SIZE UNIT (SSU) is CHARACTER, this mode is redundant and should no longer be used. F.4.2 ZDM - Zero default mode ZERO: A parameter value of 0 of a control function means the number 0. DEFAULT: A parameter value of 0 represents a default parameter value which may be different from 0.

NOTE 1

This mode was provided for implementations of the first edition of this Standard which specified that "an empty parameter sub-string or a parameter sub-string which consists of bit combinations 03/00 only represents a default value which depends on the control function". For numeric parameters which are expressed in units established by the parameter value of SELECT SIZE UNIT (SSU) the value 0 could then be specified. For numeric parameters which are effectively repeat counts, a 0 parameter value corresponded to a "no-op". In either instance, non-negative computed numeric parameter values might have been used without treating 0 as a special (unusable) case. Where an explicit parameter value was not used, implementors were urged to omit a parameter value (use an empty parameter sub-string) to imply a default parameter value. Control functions affected are: CBT, CHA, CHT, CNL, CPL, CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, CVT, DCH, DL, ECH, GSM, HPA, HPB, HPR, HVP, ICH, IL, NP, PP, PPA, PPB, PPR, REP, SD, SL, SR, SU, TCC, VPA, VPB, VPR.

NOTE 2

Since the publication of the first edition of this Standard in 1976 almost 15 years have expired. The use of this mode should no longer be required because the definition of default parameter values has been changed. F.5 Eliminated modes F.5.1 Editing Boundary Mode (EBM) The mode EDITING BOUNDARY MODE (EBM) the use of which was already declared deprecated in the fourth Edition of this Standard has now been removed. F.5.2 LINE FEED/NEW LINE MODE (LF/NL) The mode LINE FEED/NEW LINE MODE (LF/NL) the use of which was already declared deprecated in the fourth Edition of this Standard has now been removed. F.6 New control functions Five new control functions have been introduced, viz.: three control functions for bi-directional texts:     . SELECT CHARACTER PATH (SCP) . START DIRECTED STRING (SDS) . SELECT IMPLICIT MOVEMENT DIRECTION (SIMD) and two control functions for text communication: . SET PAGE HOME (SPH) . SET PAGE LIMIT (SPL) F.7 Modified control functions The control functions SELECT ALTERNATIVE PRESENTATION VARIANTS (SAPV), SELECT PRESENTATION DIRECTIONS (SPD) and START REVERSED STRING (SRS) have been amended to take into account their interaction with new control functions. A second parameter has been added to the control function SHEET EJECT AND FEED (SEF) for the selection of the output stacker. Whether the control functions CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) and NEXT LINE (NEL) move the active position (the active presentation position in the presentation component, the active data position in the data component) to the line home position or to the line limit position, has been made dependent on the parameter value of the control function SELECT IMPLICIT MOVEMENT DIRECTION (SIMD). In the definition of many other control functions small adjustments have been made; for example, references to SPD have been cancelled when no more pertinent or required, dependencies on new modes have been included in the definitions of the affected control functions, etc. For bi-directional devices the cursor control functions are active in the presentation component; they are independent of the setting of the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM). The control functions for character position or line position movements are active in the data component; they depend on the setting of the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM). Their dependency on SELECT SIZE UNIT (SSU) was removed. F.8 Eliminated control functions F.8.1 DELETE (DEL) The character DELETE (bit combination 07/15, see ISO/IEC 646, clause 6.5), not being a control function in the strict sense, has been removed from the body of the Standard. DEL was originally used to erase or obliterate an erroneous or unwanted character in punched tape. DEL characters may be inserted into, or removed from, a CC-data-element without affecting its information content, but such action may affect the information layout and/or the control of equipment. F.8.2 INDEX (IND) The control function INDEX (IND) which was coded as an element of the C1 set (08/04) and the use of which was already declared deprecated in the fourth Edition of this Standard has now been removed. F.8.3 CHARACTER TABULATION SET ABSOLUTE (HTSA) The control function CHARACTER TABULATION SET ABSOLUTE (HTSA) which was coded as a control sequence with any number of numeric parameters (CSI Pn ... 02/00 04/14) and the use of which was already declared deprecated in the fourth Edition of this Standard has now been removed. F.9 New type of control functions representing control sequences with no parameter The earlier editions of this Standard have implicitly permitted control sequences with no parameter although this type of control sequences was not explicitly specified in clause 8. Moreover, no control functions were defined which would have been represented by such control sequences. The type of control sequences with no parameter is introduced in this Edition of this Standard. When control functions represented by control sequences of this new type will have to be defined in future Editions of this Standard, it is intended that they be control sequences with the single Intermediate Byte 02/01.   .
