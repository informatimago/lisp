;;;;DESCRIPTION
;;;;
;;;;    This package loads the ECMA-048 standard text and from
;;;;    this specifications can generate functions returning
;;;;    the control sequences defined in the standard.
;;;;    The user must call for example:
;;;;
;;;;       (define-all-functions :verbose *compile-verbose*
;;;;                               :export  t
;;;;                               :8-bit   t
;;;;                               :print   nil
;;;;                               :result-type '(vector (unsigned-byte 8))))
;;;;
;;;;    to get the code function defined in the current package (*package*).
;;;;
;;;;    Note: ECMA-048 should be identical to ISO-6429.

;;;;MODIFICATIONS
;;;;    2010-10-31 <PJB> Exported symbols from defpackage for all implementations.
;;;;                     Removed short nicknames.
;;;;    2006-07-11 <PJB> Removed the code functions from this package, this
;;;;                     exporting them dynamically displeased to sbcl.
;;;;    2005-09-01 <PJB> Added ISO6429 control codes.
;;;;    2005-03-09 <PJB> Removed dependency on clisp specific REGEXP package.
