cf. how clisp debugger is written?

Purpose
#######

The general purpose would be to have an integrated development
environment providing sophisticated tools for Common Lisp development
including:

- source level steppers, tracers, debuggers,
- embedded editors.


Eventually, tools involving global analysis (type inference, tree
shakers), project structuring tools (the code would be edited in a
code browser (kind of like the Smalltalk browser), and would be
automatically saved into files by the system).



Maintaining an in-image source database serves several purposes:

- allows for interactive development, at the REPL, and after the fact
  saving of the sources forms to external files.

- having the source accessible allows for sophisticated development
  tools.
   
Notably, it allows automatic and dynamic rewriting and processing of
the source code by development tools.


Sexp Sources
============

The advantage of keeping the source Sexp is that it simple and
directly accessible and processable.

The inconvenient is that we don't keep comments, reader macros and
indenting.  Also, it may be harder to keep the real source form.  The
old IBCL prototype catches the source Sexps from various CL ``def*`` macro
calls, not from the real source macro call, that may expand to one or
more CL ``def*`` macro calls.  Also, it's easy to write source form that
build lisp objects (including functions), without going thru CL ``def*``
macros (eg. ``make-package``, ``(setf symbol-function)``, etc.).


Text Sources
============

The inconvenients are:

- the text form is bigger than the Sexp form (there are already 360 MB
  of ``.lisp``/``.asd`` sources in ``~/quicklisp``). 

- each processing the text form requires re-reading it (which requires
  to keep track of the read-time ``*package*`` and the ``*readtable*``
  with its set of activated reader macros, taking into account the
  possibility that the old ``*package*`` is deleted (and possibly
  re-created), and which means that the same text source may become
  invalid.

Therefore we may also want to keep the derived Sexp source in
parallel.

The advantage is that we keep the comments, reader macros and
indenting.



Text Sources + CL + Emacs + Slime
=================================

The current setup includes:

- text source files in the host file system.

- a Common Lisp implementation, usually compiling the lisp sources
  into write-only binary.

- Swank/Slime to interface the CL implementation with emacs.

- emacs text editor.


Several difficuties appears in this setup, because of the indirection
between the source code and the tools used to develop them.

- emacs is a text editor, even with the addition of paredit, it's not
  really a structured editor;  even if we don't want or need to edit
  directly the sexp structure, emacs doesn't provide tools to edit
  eg. toplevel forms with no relation to file system files.

- CL implementations may or may not keep track of the source file and
  position for each compiled function (and perhaps subexpression).
  Notably they don't keep the source text for forms entered at the REPL
  (and what REPL?  slime REPL or the ``*inferior-lisp*`` REPL?).

- slime needs information from the CL implementation to jump to the
  file positions corresponding to the debugging frames.  It cannot
  provide stepping or other sophisticated source-level debugging
  features.


Project
###########

- comments ``;…``, ``#|…|#``, ``#+(or)…``, ``#-(and)…``.
- other standard or user reader macros ``#.…``,  ``#x…``, ``#b…`` etc.
- indenting, or rather, line splitting, since indenting is done
  automatically.

The editing unit shall be the toplevel form.  Text source blocks shall
contain a single toplevel form, or a single toplevel comment block.
If an editing block is valided containing several toplevel forms, it's
split into as many toplevel forms.

Editing units can A source browser shall allow the classification



Source Persistence
==================

The text source can be kept in files when it comes from files.  Then
we only need the pathname and file positions to refer to it.

In the case of the REPL, we can read and keep the text, or save it to
a dribble file.




Project structure
====================

File based structure
--------------------

Quicklisp: 

    A DAG of interdependent asdf systems.

ASDF: 

    A DAG of interdependent lisp files.

Lisp: 

    A set of packages.  There may be circularities in package
    dependencies, but not in the source files: defpackage forms cannot
    define a circular dependency, (and notably, redefining a package
    in a second defpackage is unspecified), but other toplevel forms
    can establish later circular dependencies.  So while the set of
    packages may form a graph in general, the text source of
    defpackage forms is a DAG.  The evaluation of each toplevel form
    builds one or more objects.  

The toplevel forms are read each in a specific package, and in a
specific order.  However, this order can be infered.


Image based structure
---------------------

This kind of project is built in memory and the objects composing it
form a graph in general.  There's no need to save them in files that
will have to be loaded in a specific order (DAG).  The editing units
are kept to allow for the editing of the objects.

In this structure persistence is assured by saving the whole image.

Saving the editing units would pose the problem of reloading them,
since they may have circular dependencies.  (There may be a way to
still load them automatically despite the circular dependencies, by
loading the cycles repeatitively until a fixed point is reached).


Reading
===============


Reading from a file
----------------------

We may wrap each reader macro to take note of the file and positions
of the text processed by the reader macro.


Reading from the REPL
----------------------

Reading from the REPL or other non-file based streams, we need to wrap
the stream to save the text that is processed by the reader macros.
This can be done with gray streams, or by a hook in the lisp reader.

This way to save the editing unit can also be used when reading from
the file.

(Note: not only read-char, but read-line or read-sequence; cf. gray
streams).


Read-Eval
---------

Once the text is read, a lisp object "source form" and an editing unit
(text and/or file & positions) are produced by the lisp reader.
Notice: only a single object reference is returned by the lisp reader.
    

When reading "(a . (b . nil))", we have five lisp objects: two conses
and three symbols.  The two conses can be associated with that editing
unit (and even, to different positions).  The symbols could also be
associated with this editing unit and positions, but they would have
also other associations with other editing units, unless we want to
identify the place where the symbol was interned first, which wouldn't
be too useful.  But the point is that with: ::

   (defparameter *a* '(a . (b . nil)))   ; line 1
   (defparameter *b* (cdr *a*))          ; line 2

- The source of the value of ``*a*`` is line 1.
- The source of the value of ``*b*`` is line 1 too!
- The source of the definition of ``*b*`` is line 2.



The source form is evaluated.  It may contain macros that are
macroexpanded.  This may create and register several lisp objects
(packages, variables, functions, methods, etc, and other lisp
objects).  All those lisp objects could be associated with the source
form and the editing unit.  Collecting all the lisp objects created by
the evaluation of a source form would require access to the
implementation (or the use of an interpreter).

::

    (package 'x)
    (symbol-value 'x)
    (symbol-function 'x)
    (find-class 'x)
    type 'x
    (find-method (function x) …) ; <---
    (color 'x)
    (thingy 'x)
    (grammar 'x)
    (etc 'x)


Each object created has a "source".  A function that creates an object
at run-time may be considered the source of that object.  So asking
where this object has been created, we can return this function, or
even this function call: ::

    (defun f (ch)
       (list (string ch)))
    ;;   ^1     ^2

    (f #\x) --> ("x")

- Source of ("x") is function call ^1 in function F. (Why not a call
  to CL:CONS in CL:LIST?)
- Source of "x" is function call ^2 in function F.
