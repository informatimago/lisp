===============================
Common Lisp Source Code Stepper
===============================


Random notes.

TODO
===========

- break on condition.

- implement a cl-stepper:break to integrate with the stepper.

- improve interactivity when entering the stepper upon a break (on
  entry or exit).  

     + We want to be able to continue to next break.

     + See if we can add breakpoints without recompiling (and
       therefore while debugging).
       (ie. each step point can be a break-point).

- extend into a full debugger.


Terminology
===========

The term "to trace" here doen't mean CL:TRACE, but executing forms
while printing each subexpressions before evaluating them and printing
their results once they return (or informing of a non-local exit).
The same printing is done while stepping, but interrupted by user
interaction to let him decide what to do next (step into, step over,
trace or "run").

The terms "to run" here means to evaluate the form (or the remaining
of the evaluation of the form) without printing any trace.

Whenever breakpoints are implemented however, tracing and running
would stop at the next breakpoint encountered.



Principle of operation
======================


Since we don't have yet the infrastructure to manage editing units
(text source along with sexp source, etc), we'll take a few shortcuts.

The main problem is to get at the source sexp for the functions and
methods to be stepped and traced.  For this, we cannot count on
``function-lambda-expression``, and it would be largely insufficient
anyways: we want to implement the CL:STEP API allowing to step into a
toplevel or stand-alone form, and we may want to trace or step into
the loading of a lisp file too.


Eager Option
------------

In the eager option, we instrument all the toplevel forms we read as
soon as we read them.

- we need to implement a LOAD function.
- difficulties with ASDF which tries to compile everything first, so:
- we need to implement a COMPILE-FILE function too.
- and of course, we may want to provide a REPL (⚠ slime).


Lazy Option
-----------

In the lazy option, we only instrument the forms and the functions or
methods needed to perform he stepping or tracing.  This require
keeping around the source forms.  Note this means definiting reader
macros (to keep text source) or macros (as done by IBCL).


Macro Option
------------

IBCL only keeps the source of predefined macros (a subset of the CL
def* macros), so we may miss user defined macros (define-such-and-such…),
unless they expand to CL def* macros.

With a macro that would expand to something like: ::

(progn
(setf (gethash 'some-key *some-hash*) (some-object (lambda () 'some-code)))
(cl:defun something ()
'some-code))

we would instrument the function ``something``, but not the anonymous
function or code possibly returned by the ``some-object`` function.


But we can define alternate special operators as macro too.

The big advantage of this solution is that it allows to capture
closures without effort: ::

    (shadow '(let cl:defun))
    (defmacro let (bindings &body body)
      `(cl:let ,(generate-stepping-bindings bindings)
        ,@(generate-stepping-body body)))
    (defmacro cl:defun (name lambda-list &body body)
      `(cl:cl:defun ,name ,lambda-list
        ,@(generate-stepping-function name lambda-list body)))
    (let ((x 42))
        (cl:defun g () x)
        (cl:defun s (z) (setf x z)))


At minimum we only have to define macros for (lambda cl:defun defgeneric
defmethod) in addition to the special operators.  But we could define
wrappers for all the CL macros to catch them as toplevel forms too.
This would be useful also for implementations that expands standard
macros into non-standard special operators.  Otherwise, macros expand
eventually to special operators so we should be able to trace the
execution of the expansion there, unless they expand to a single
function call.

    with-input-from-string with-open-file with-open-stream
    with-output-to-string with-package-iterator with-simple-restart
    with-slots with-standard-io-syntax)


- we define macros for the special operators and (lambda defun defgeneric
defmethod).

- we process step interaction using restarts, and breaking into the
debugger.  This allows for easy integration into the debugger.

- progn and similary special operators with body will have to
macroexpand the body expressions to catch the function calls.

Note
----------

In ccl, a macro like cl:defmethod expands to implementation specific
special operators (ccl:nfunction) or even, to calls to internal
functions passing lambda expressions or other code chunks as data.
This would prevent their instrumenting by IBCL-like macros.
