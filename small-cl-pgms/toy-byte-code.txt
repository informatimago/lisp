Somebody asked:

I have this language.  

    pgm          ::= stmt* .
    stmt         ::= block-stmt | if-stmt | while-stmt | assign-expr .
    block-stmt   ::= '{' stmt* '}' .
    if-stmt      ::= 'if' logic-expr 'then' stmt .
    while-stmt   ::= 'while' logic-expr 'do' stmt .
    assign-expr  ::= identifier '=' logic-expr ';' .
    logic-expr   ::= compar-expr { logic-op compar-expr } .
    compare-expr ::= sum-expr { compare-op sum-expr } .
    sump-expr    ::= prod-expr { sum-op prod-expr } .
    prod-expr    ::= simple-expr { prod-op simple-expr } .
    simple-expr  ::= identifier | literal | '(' logic-expr ')' | assign-expr .
    identifier   := /[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*/ .
    literal      := /[-+]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?/ .

How do I write a byte-code compiler for it?

----------------------------------------


Any Turing complete language can be translated to any Turing complete
language.

So assuming your small toy language is Turing complete, you can
compile it to any bytecode you want, as long as it's Turing complete
too.

You don't need much for a language to be Turing complete.  On a
processor, you only need a single instruction:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer

I have a little conjecture that says that given the expressivity E1 of
language L1, the expressivity E2 of language L2, and the complexity
C12 of the compiler C(E1,E2), the following relationship exists:

      L1=C12*L2

That is, if you are compiling a language very expressive into a
language not expressive, then you need a complex compiler.  And
vice-versa.

That means that if you're free to choose the language L2 (designing
your own byte code), then you can minimize compiler complexity by
choosing L2 to be L1, or a more powerful (more expressive) language.

On the other hand, if you know how to build complex compilers, you can
design a very simple (unexpressive) language L2 (such as a One
Instruction Set Computer).


What's missing in your specification is the semantics of your
language.   The syntax of a language is the less important thing.  For
the sake of the discussion, I will assume you mean semantics similar
to that of the following interpreter.


Note: all the code following is written as toy code; real interpreters,
virtual machines and compilers would be structured differently, having
to deal with more cases and more details, notably error handling etc.
Also, source code at:

    (defstruct tl-env
      (variables (make-hash-table)))

    (defun tl-var (env identifier)
      (gethash identifier (tl-env-variables env) 0))

    (defun (setf tl-var) (new-value env identifier)
      (setf (gethash identifier (tl-env-variables env)) new-value))


    (defun tl-eval (env &rest stmt*)
      (dolist (stmt stmt*)
        (ecase (first stmt)
          ((block) (apply (function tl-eval) env (rest stmt)))
          ((if)    (if (tl-expr-assign env (second stmt))
                       (tl-eval env (third stmt))))
          ((while) (loop :while (tl-expr-assign env (second stmt))
                     :do (tl-eval env (third stmt))))
          ((assign) (tl-expr-assign env stmt)))))

    (defun tl-expr-assign (env expr-assign)
      (if (atom expr-assign)
          (tl-expr env expr-assign)
          (case (first expr-assign)
            ((assign) (setf (tl-var env (second expr-assign))
                            (tl-expr-assign env (third expr-assign))))
            (otherwise (tl-expr env expr-assign)))))

    (defparameter *tl-ops*
      (list (list '&& (lambda (&rest args) (every (function identity) args)))
            (list '|| (lambda (&rest args) (some  (function identity) args)))
            (list '<  (function <))
            (list '>  (function >))
            (list '== (function =))
            (list '<> (function /=))
            (list '+  (function +))
            (list '-  (function -))
            (list '*  (function *))
            (list '/  (function /))))

    (defun tl-expr (env expr)
      (cond
        ((symbolp expr) (tl-var env expr))
        ((numberp expr) expr)
        ((atom expr) (error "Invalid atom ~S" expr))
        (t (let ((entry (assoc (first expr) *tl-ops*)))
             (if entry
                 (apply (second entry) (mapcar (lambda (expr) (tl-expr env expr)) (rest expr)))
                 (error "Invalid operation ~S" (first expr)))))))


This allows us to write programs in your language:

    (tl-expr-assign (make-tl-env) '(assign i (* 42 42)))
    --> 1764

    (let ((env  (make-tl-env)))
      (tl-eval env
                     '(block
                       (assign i 42)
                       (assign j 33)
                       (while (<> i j)
                         (block
                             (if (< i j)
                                 (assign j (- j i)))
                           (if (< j i)
                               (assign i (- i j)))))))
      (tl-var env 'i))
    --> 3


    (defun hash-table-to-alist (ht)
      (let ((result '()))
        (maphash (lambda (key value) 
                   (setq result (acons key value result)))
                 ht)
        result))


    (let ((env (make-tl-env)))
      (tl-eval env
                     '(block
                       (assign i (* 42 42))
                       (if (< i 0) (assign j -1))
                       (if (> i 0) (assign j +1))
                       (assign k (- i 12))
                       (while (< 0 i)
                         (assign i (- i 12)))))
      (hash-table-to-alist (tl-env-variables env)))
    --> ((k . 1752) (i . 0) (j . 1))



But one problem of specifying the semantics with such an interpreter,
is that it gives too much a specification.  For example, Common Lisp
uses a deterministic order evaluation of the arguments; your language
may want to have a semantics where the order of evaluation of the
arguments is not determined (which leaves more freedom to the
compiler, which makes it simplier).  We will assume that the order of
evaluation of the arguments is not specified in the semantics of the
language, so that we can compile them in any order (but it's more
agreable for a programmer to work with a deterministic argument
evaluation order).

Since there's no I/O primitives, and since there are statements that
are distinguished from expressions (a very bad design error), we have
to dump the environment after evaluating statements to know what
happened.


Now if we want to design another language that could run those kinds
of programs, to be able to convert easily from your language to this
new language we notice that we'll need:

* a way to create variables, to read their value, to store their
  value, in a global environment.

* a way to execute a sequence of instructions.

* a way to jump around according to the result of some instruction.

* a way to compute those operations: and or less-than greater-than
  equal not-equal add subtract multipl y and divide.

* it's not specified what data types are available (the  interpreter
  above, written in Common Lisp, can handle integers, floating points,
  rationals, complexes).  Your syntax seems to allow only decimal
  numbers literals, but the semantics of your language could include
  rationals or other numbers:  1 / 3 --> 1/3

Since computing expressions seems to be an important part of your
language, perhaps a stack machine would be a nice target language.

The term "byte-code" only qualifies the format of the target language,
but not its semantics, not the complexity and sophistication of the
target processor.  We could just take the source of your language,
convert it into ASCII bytes, and call that a byte code, to be run by
the target language (which would be the same as the source language,
therefore the complexity of the compiler would be 1).  "byte" is also
a relatively generic term.  You may or may not exclude "symbolic"
values. If you allow only numerical values, then do you impose a
range? Eg. if you say 0-255, then how do you want to proceed with
literal numbers that are bigger?  How do you encode decimal numbers?
(You may want an immediate addressing mode, or you can have to store
them in memory).  In any case, you will need literal addresses, so you
need a way to encode bigger numbers into small bytes.

Without any constraints, you have a lot of choices to make to design
your "byte code" language.


Here, I will make some choices for you, but you could choose
completely different a design.

Let's have a machine that has three memories:

* a data memory, where each cell can contain values of any lisp number
  types, directly addressable.

* a stack memory, where each cell can contain values of any lisp
  number types, organized as stack.

* a program memory, where each cell can contain one octet 0-255.
  Instructions are encoded as one octet.  Some instructions may
  require an immediate address encoded as two octets in big endian
  order, or an immediate relative address encoded as two octets in big
  endian order (always positive).

* there's a stack pointer into the stack memory managed by the
  processor. Some instructions push values on the stack, some pop
  values from the stack.

* there's an instruction pointer (program counter).

* the processor can execute the following instructions:


   0 AND   (push (and (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)
   1 OR    (push (or  (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)
   2 LT    (push (<   (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)
   3 GT    (push (>   (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)
   4 EQ    (push (=   (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)
   5 NE    (push (/=  (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)

The result pushed on the stack is not numerical, but boolean values.


   6 ADD   (push (+   (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)
   7 SUB   (push (-   (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)
   8 MUL   (push (*   (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)
   9 DIV   (push (/   (pop stack) (pop stack)) stack)

The result pushed on the stack is a number, if the arguments are numbers.
In case of error (type or arithmetic (division by zero)), the program stops.
Note:  (load&push i) (load&push j) (sub) (pop&store k) ==  (assign k (- j i))

   10 LOAD&PUSH address   (push (aref data address) stack) 
   11 POP&STORE address   (setf (aref data address) (pop stack))


Branch Forward if False

   12 BFOF relative       (if (not (pop stack))  (incf pc relative))


Branch Backward Always:

   13 BBA relative       (decf pc relative)

End:

   14 STOP               stops the machine.


The compiler will have to collect all the variables and literal
numbers and assign them a cell in the data memory.

                      (vector-push-extend (codop (first instruction)) code)
                      (vector-push-extend (ldb (byte 8 8) relative) code)
                      (vector-push-extend (ldb (byte 8 0) relative) code)))
                   (otherwise
                    (vector-push-extend (codop (first instruction)) code))))
           :finally (return code))
         ;; generate the data vector:
         (map 'vector (lambda (item) (if (symbolp item) 0 item)) data)
         ;; program symbol table:
         program
         ;; data symbol table:
         data)))

    (defmacro lap (&body body)
      `(lap* ',body))


So we can write little assembler programs for our machine:

    (lap
     (loadi&push 42)
     (pop&store i)
     (loadi&push 33)
     (pop&store j)
     :while
     (load&push j)
     (load&push i)
     (eq)
     (bfof :end-while)
     :if-1
     (load&push j)
     (load&push i)
     (lt)
     (bfof :end-if-1)
     (load&push i)
     (load&push j)
     (sub)
     (pop&store j)
     :end-if-1
     :if-2
     (load&push i)
     (load&push j)
     (lt)
     (bfof :end-if-2)
     (load&push j)
     (load&push i)
     (sub)
     (pop&store i)
     :end-if-2
     (bba :while)
     :end-while
     (stop))
    --> #(10 0 0 11 0 3 10 0 1 11 0 2 10 0 2 10 0 3 4 12 0 43 10 0 2 10 0 3 2 12 0 10 10 0 3 10 0 2 7 11 0 2 10 0 3 10 0 2 2 12 0 10 10 0 2 10 0 3 7 11 0 3 13 0 53 14)
        #(42 33 0 0)
        ((:end-while . 65) (:end-if-2 . 62) (:if-2 . 42) (:end-if-1 . 42) (:if-1 . 22) (:while . 12))
        #(42 33 j i)


And we can run programs:

    (setf *print-length* 20)

    (let ((machine (make-machine)))
      (multiple-value-bind (program data ptable dtable)
          (lap
           (loadi&push 42)
           (pop&store i)
           (loadi&push 33)
           (pop&store j)
           :while
           (load&push j)
           (load&push i)
           (ne)
           (bfof :end-while)
           :if-1
           (load&push j)
           (load&push i)
           (lt)
           (bfof :end-if-1)
           (load&push i)
           (load&push j)
           (sub)
           (pop&store j)
           :end-if-1
           :if-2
           (load&push j)
           (load&push i)
           (gt)
           (bfof :end-if-2)
           (load&push j)
           (load&push i)
           (sub)
           (pop&store i)
           :end-if-2
           (bba :while)
           :end-while
           (stop))
        (load-program machine data program)
        (machine-run machine)
        machine))
    --> #S(machine :memory #(42 33 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...)
                   :stack nil
                   :program #(10 0 0 11 0 3 10 0 1 11 0 2 10 0 2 10 0 3 5 12 ...)
                   :pc 66
                   :stopped t)

(gcd 33 42) --> 3, we indeed get 3 in the i and j cells.

There remains now to write a compiler.

Since we have an assembler that deals with the symbol tables, we can
defer to it.  Also since we have instructions to implement directly
each of our primitives, we don't need to deal with a run-time library
and so on.  So the compiler will be quite simple and direct.

    (defun tl-compile (&rest stmt*)

    return:  the same as LAP*.

So we can now generate code from your language:

                                (assign i (- i j)))))))
    --> #(10 0 0 11 0 3 10 0 1 11 0 2 10 0 2 10 0 3 5 12 0 43 10 0 2 10 0 3 2 12 0 10 10 0 3 10 0 2 7 11 0 2 10 0 3 10 0 2 2 12 0 10 10 0 2 10 0 3 7 11 0 3 13 0 53)

        #(42 33 j i)


and compile and run programs:

    (let ((machine (make-machine)))
      (multiple-value-bind (program data ptable dtable)
          (tl-compile '(block

                   :pc 66
                   :stopped t)

Writing the scanner and parser that will generate syntactic trees such as:

    (block
      (assign i 42)
      (assign j 33)
      (while (<> i j)
        (block
            (if (< i j)
                (assign j (- j i)))
          (if (< j i)
              (assign i (- i j))))))

from the specified grammar is left to tools such as lex and yacc (or
cl-ppcre and cl-yacc).
